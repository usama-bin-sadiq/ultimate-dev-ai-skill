<!-- Moved verbatim from landing-report/SKILL.md, the

     unchanged, and it is here so SKILL.md stays the routing
     surface rather than a manual. -->

## Step 5: Suggest next action

After rendering the table, suggest ONE of:

1. **If there are collisions in the queue** (two open PRs claim the same version):
   "⚠ Two open PRs collide on v<X>. Whoever merges second will either overwrite
   the first's CHANGELOG entry or land a duplicate. Consider asking one author
   to rerun /ship to pick up the next free slot."

2. **If an active sibling outranks the user's branch version:**
   "Sibling worktree <path> has v<X> committed <N>h ago and hasn't PR'd yet.
   If that work ships first, your branch will need to rebump at land time."

3. **If everything looks clean:**
   "Queue is clean. Next /ship will claim a slot without conflict."
