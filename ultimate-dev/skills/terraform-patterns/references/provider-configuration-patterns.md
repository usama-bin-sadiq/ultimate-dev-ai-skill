## Provider Configuration Patterns

### Version Pinning
```hcl
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.5.0"

  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 5.0"    # Allow 5.x, block 6.0
    }
    random = {
      source  = "hashicorp/random"
      version = "~> 3.5"
    }
  }
}
```

### Multi-Region with Aliases
```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

provider "aws" {
  alias  = "west"
  region = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "primary" {
  bucket = "my-app-primary"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "replica" {
  provider = aws.west
  bucket   = "my-app-replica"
}
```

### Multi-Account with Assume Role
```hcl
provider "aws" {
  alias  = "production"
  region = "us-east-1"

  assume_role {
    role_arn = "arn:aws:iam::PROD_ACCOUNT_ID:role/TerraformRole"
  }
}
```
