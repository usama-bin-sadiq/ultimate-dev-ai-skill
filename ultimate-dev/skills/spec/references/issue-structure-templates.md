# Issue Structure Templates

### Standard Issues (default; also used for `--bug`, `--feature`, `--refactor` framings)

```
## Context

[2-3 sentences: what exists today, why it's insufficient, why now. Frame from the
stakeholder perspective — who is affected and why they care.]

## Current State

[Verified description of current behavior. Audit table if this affects one member
of a family. File paths and line numbers. Verification date if state could drift.]

## Proposed Change

[What changes. Architecture diagram if helpful.]

### Implementation Details

[Specific files, schemas, API shapes, patterns to follow. Zero design decisions
left for the implementer.]

## Acceptance Criteria

1. [Specific, pass/fail, no subjective language]
2. [...]
3. Tests written and passing
4. No degradation of existing functionality

## Testing Plan

| Layer       | What                     | Count |
|-------------|--------------------------|-------|
| Unit        | [specific methods/logic] | +N    |
| Integration | [specific flows]         | +N    |
| E2E         | [specific user journeys] | +N    |

## Rollback Plan

[How to undo if something goes wrong]

## Effort Estimate

[Per-component breakdown]

## Files Reference

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `path/to/file:line` | What changes here |

## Out of Scope

- [Thing that seems related but is NOT part of this issue]

## Related

- #NNN — [related issue/PR]
```

### Epics

Add to the standard template:

```
## Child Issues

| # | Title | Priority | Effort | Status | Dependencies |
|---|-------|----------|--------|--------|--------------|

## Dependency Graph

[ASCII diagram]

## Sequencing Rationale

[Why this order — what breaks if reordered]

## Definition of Done

1. [Numbered, specific, measurable verification checkpoints]
```

### Audit / Cleanup Issues (routed via `--audit` flag)

Add to the standard template:

```
## Full Inventory

[Every instance — file paths, line numbers, code snippets. Exact count, not
"about N." Table format.]

## What's Working Well (Do Not Touch)

[Things that look like targets but must NOT be changed]

## Execution Plan

[Phases ordered by risk/dependency, with ordering rationale]
```
