## Issue Quality Standards

### 1. Stakeholder Context ("Why This Matters")

Explain who cares and why — from the end user, product, and engineering
perspectives. The implementer should understand the *value* they're delivering,
not just the mechanics.

### 2. Verified Current State

Document what exists today before proposing changes. Cite specific files, line
numbers, and observed behavior. Include a verification date if the state could
drift.

### 3. Audit Tables for Landscape Context

When the change affects one member of a family (one worker, one endpoint, one
service), show the *full landscape* — what's already correct, what needs work,
how they compare. This prevents tunnel vision and reveals related problems.

```
| Component | Has X | Has Y | Gap     |
|-----------|-------|-------|---------|
| Widget A  | ✅    | ❌    | Needs Y |
| Widget B  | ❌    | ✅    | Needs X |
| Widget C  | ✅    | ✅    | None    |
```

### 4. Quantified Impact

Numbers, not adjectives. Percentages, counts, dollars, time savings, row counts,
before/after. "Several files" → "47 files across 12 directories." "Improves
performance" → "reduces query from ~500ms to ~50ms (10x)." If you lack numbers,
say so and explain how to get them.

### 5. Prioritized Recommendations with Rationale

Tier work (Critical / High / Medium / Low) with a one-sentence rationale per
tier. Explain the *sequencing rationale* — why this order, not just what the
order is.

### 6. "What's Working Well" / "Do Not Touch"

For audit or refactoring issues, explicitly state what is correct and must not
change. Prevents the implementer from "fixing" non-broken things into
regressions.

### 7. Dependency Graphs for Multi-Part Work

```
#1 Foundation ─┬─> #2 Core Feature A
               └─> #3 Core Feature B ──> #4 Advanced Feature

#5 Independent (can start anytime)
```

Include a rationale explaining *why* this order.

### 8. Schema, API Shapes, and Data Models

Actual SQL, actual interfaces, actual request/response shapes — not pseudocode,
not descriptions. Close enough that the implementer makes zero design decisions.

### 9. File Reference Table

Full paths from repo root. Line numbers when referencing specific logic.

```
| File                        | Change                         |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `src/services/order.py`     | Add expiry check               |
| `src/services/order.py:42`  | Fix null handling in get_by_id |
| `tests/test_order.py`       | New tests for expiry           |
```

### 10. Testable Acceptance Criteria

Numbered. Pass/fail. No subjective language.

- ✅ "Orders older than 30 days return HTTP 410 for all 4 user roles"
- ✅ "Query time for 10K-row table under 100ms (EXPLAIN ANALYZE)"
- ❌ "The feature works correctly"
- ❌ "Edge cases are handled"

### 11. Testing Pyramid

Specify what to test at each layer:

```
| Layer       | What                               | Count |
|-------------|------------------------------------|-------|
| Unit        | `order_service.is_expired()`       | +3    |
| Integration | Create order → expire → verify 410 | +2    |
| E2E         | Login → view orders → see expired  | +1    |
```

### 12. Root Cause Analysis (bugs and quality issues)

Explain *why* the problem exists before proposing the fix. The implementer needs
the root cause to validate the solution and avoid introducing the same class of
bug elsewhere.

### 13. Effort Breakdown

Per-component, not just a total. "~12h" → "2h schema + 3h service + 4h tests +
3h frontend." Enables planning and task splitting.

### 14. Rollback Strategy

For anything touching data, infrastructure, or shared state: how do we undo
this? Even "revert the PR" is worth stating explicitly.
