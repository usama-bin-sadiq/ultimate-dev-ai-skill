## Section 6: Best Practices & Quality Checks

### Before You Start
1. **Define the peer group** - Companies must be truly comparable (similar business model, scale, geography)
2. **Choose the right period** - LTM smooths seasonality; quarterly shows trends
3. **Standardize units upfront** - Millions vs. billions decision affects everything
4. **Map data sources** - Know where each number comes from

### As You Build
1. **Input all raw data first** - Complete the blue text before writing formulas
2. **Add cell comments to ALL hard-coded inputs** - Right-click cell → Insert Comment → Document source OR assumption

   **For sourced data, cite exactly where it came from:**
   - Example: "Bloomberg Terminal - MSFT Equity DES, accessed 2024-10-02"
   - Example: "Q4 2024 10-K filing, page 42, line item 'Total Revenue'"
   - Example: "FactSet consensus estimate as of 2024-10-02"
   - **Include hyperlinks when possible**: Right-click cell → Link → paste URL to SEC filing, data source, or report

   **For assumptions, explain the reasoning:**
   - Example: "Assumed 15% EBITDA margin based on peer median, company does not disclose"
   - Example: "Estimated Enterprise Value as Market Cap + $50M net debt (from Q3 balance sheet, Q4 not yet available)"
   - Example: "Forward P/E based on street consensus EPS of $3.45 (average of 12 analyst estimates)"

   **Why this matters**: Enables audit trails, data verification, assumption transparency, and future updates
3. **Build formulas row by row** - Test each calculation before moving on
4. **Use absolute references for headers** - $C$6 locks the header row
5. **Format consistently** - Percentages as percentages, not decimals
6. **Add conditional formatting** - Highlight outliers automatically

### Sanity Checks
- **Margin test**: Gross margin > EBITDA margin > Net margin (always true by definition)
- **Multiple reasonableness**: 
  - EV/Revenue: typically 0.5-20x (varies widely by industry)
  - EV/EBITDA: typically 8-25x (fairly consistent across industries)
  - P/E: typically 10-50x (depends on growth rate)
- **Growth-multiple correlation**: Higher growth usually means higher multiples
- **Size-efficiency trade-off**: Larger companies often have better margins (scale benefits)

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
❌ Mixing market cap and enterprise value in formulas
❌ Using different time periods for numerator and denominator (LTM vs quarterly)
❌ Hardcoding numbers into formulas instead of cell references
❌ **Hard-coded inputs without cell comments citing the source OR explaining the assumption**
❌ Missing hyperlinks to SEC filings or data sources when available
❌ Including too many metrics without clear purpose
❌ Including non-comparable companies (different business models)
❌ Using outdated data without disclosure
❌ Calculating averages of percentages incorrectly (should be median)
