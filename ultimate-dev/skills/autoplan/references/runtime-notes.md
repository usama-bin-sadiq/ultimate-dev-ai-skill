# Runtime notes

This file was adapted to be tool-neutral: it claimed a general scope and was
bound to one tool. The procedure is unchanged; what changed is that a reader on a
different runtime is told what to substitute.

- **`gstack-skill-start`** — the preamble script gstack installs alongside the
  skill. It prints the `KEY: value` STATUS lines (`SKILL_START`, `SESSION_ID`,
  `SESSION_KIND`, `CONDUCTOR_SESSION`, `TEL_START`) and any
  `GSTACK_INSTRUCTION_BEGIN`/`_END` block that the phases above branch on.
  **Claude Code** and **Codex** both install it. A runtime with no gstack
  dispatcher produces no STATUS lines at all, so take each branch's own stated
  default and skip the onboarding and telemetry steps, which are marker-gated
  and therefore lose nothing.
- **slash-command dispatch** (`/review`, `/qa`, and so on) — how the phases are
  entered. **Claude Code** exposes them as slash commands; **Codex** exposes the
  same skills as `@name` invocations. A runtime with neither still has the
  procedure: the numbered phases in this file, run in order, in one context.
- **`AskUserQuestion`, `Agent`, `ExitPlanMode`** — host tool names, not concepts.
  **Claude Code** provides all three natively; **Codex** provides its own
  equivalents, and this file already treats the `mcp__*__AskUserQuestion`
  variant as a third path. Where a runtime has no question tool, use the
  **prose fallback** this file already specifies and stop for a typed answer.
  Where it has no subagent tool, run the isolated-reviewer step sequentially and
  record that you did.
- **`Agent`** — the host's subagent tool, used here to get an isolated context for
  a reviewer. **Claude Code** provides it; **Codex** spawns a session instead. A
  runtime with neither can only approximate isolation by ending and restarting
  the session, and should say so rather than claim a fresh context it did not get.
- **`codex exec`, `claude -p`** — how a phase is handed a fresh context. Two
  different CLIs for one purpose, so this binding is not single-vendor; a runtime
  that ships neither can only approximate isolation, by ending and
restarting the session.
- **`~/.gstack/`** — gstack's own per-user state: session id, plan file,
  skill-usage log. It is where this toolkit puts its state, not a location any
  other runtime reads.
- **`bun run gen:skill-docs`** — this file is generated from a template by the
  toolkit's own build step. Edits made here are overwritten on the next
  regeneration; the template is the place a change has to be made to survive.
- **`mcp__*__AskUserQuestion`** — a wildcard over *any* MCP server exposing that
  tool, not a required server. Read it as "whatever the host's MCP layer calls
  it", and treat its absence as the no-question-tool case above.
- **plugin install layout** — some of this file's siblings are described as
  arriving through a plugin rather than a skills directory. That is one delivery
  mechanism; a runtime that reads the same `SKILL.md` from a plain directory
  needs no plugin.
Anything marked **means** is an implementation detail of one tool, and a reader
on a different runtime may need a different mechanism for the same step. Anything
marked **subject** means the capability is genuinely about that tool, and a reader
without it should not expect this file to apply.
