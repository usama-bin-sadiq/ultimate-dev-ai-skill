## Integration with Plugin Components

Commands can integrate with other plugin components for powerful workflows.

### Agent Integration

Launch plugin agents for complex tasks:

```markdown
---
description: Deep code review
argument-hint: [file-path]
---

Initiate comprehensive review of @$1 using the code-reviewer agent.

The agent will analyze:

- Code structure
- Security issues
- Performance
- Best practices

Agent uses plugin resources:

- ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/config/rules.json
- ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/checklists/review.md
```

**Key points:**

- Agent must exist in `plugin/agents/` directory
- Claude uses Task tool to launch agent
- Document agent capabilities
- Reference plugin resources agent uses

### Skill Integration

Leverage plugin skills for specialized knowledge:

```markdown
---
description: Document API with standards
argument-hint: [api-file]
---

Document API in @$1 following plugin standards.

Use the api-docs-standards skill to ensure:

- Complete endpoint documentation
- Consistent formatting
- Example quality
- Error documentation

Generate production-ready API docs.
```

**Key points:**

- Skill must exist in `plugin/skills/` directory
- Mention skill name to trigger invocation
- Document skill purpose
- Explain what skill provides

### Hook Coordination

Design commands that work with plugin hooks:

- Commands can prepare state for hooks to process
- Hooks execute automatically on tool events
- Commands should document expected hook behavior
- Guide Claude on interpreting hook output

See `references/plugin-features-reference.md` for examples of commands that coordinate with hooks

### Multi-Component Workflows

Combine agents, skills, and scripts:

```markdown
---
description: Comprehensive review workflow
argument-hint: [file]
allowed-tools: Bash(node:*), Read
---

Target: @$1

Phase 1 - Static Analysis:
!`node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/lint.js $1`

Phase 2 - Deep Review:
Launch code-reviewer agent for detailed analysis.

Phase 3 - Standards Check:
Use coding-standards skill for validation.

Phase 4 - Report:
Template: @${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/review.md

Compile findings into report following template.
```

**When to use:**

- Complex multi-step workflows
- Leverage multiple plugin capabilities
- Require specialized analysis
- Need structured outputs
