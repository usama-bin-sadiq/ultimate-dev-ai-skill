## When to invoke this skill

Warns before rm -rf, DROP TABLE,
force-push, git reset --hard, kubectl delete, and similar destructive operations.
User can override each warning. Use when touching prod, debugging live systems,
or working in a shared environment. Use when asked to "be careful", "safety mode",
"prod mode", or "careful mode".

# /careful — Destructive Command Guardrails

Safety mode is now **active**. Every bash command will be checked for destructive
patterns before running. If a destructive command is detected, you'll be warned
and can choose to proceed or cancel.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.gstack/analytics
echo '{"skill":"careful","ts":"'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'","repo":"'$(basename "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)" 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown")'"}'  >> ~/.gstack/analytics/skill-usage.jsonl 2>/dev/null || true
```

## What's protected

| Pattern | Example | Risk |
|---------|---------|------|
| `rm -rf` / `rm -r` / `rm --recursive` | `rm -rf /var/data` | Recursive delete |
| `DROP TABLE` / `DROP DATABASE` | `DROP TABLE users;` | Data loss |
| `TRUNCATE` | `TRUNCATE orders;` | Data loss |
| `git push --force` / `-f` | `git push -f origin main` | History rewrite |
| `git reset --hard` | `git reset --hard HEAD~3` | Uncommitted work loss |
| `git checkout .` / `git restore .` | `git checkout .` | Uncommitted work loss |
| `kubectl delete` | `kubectl delete pod` | Production impact |
| `docker rm -f` / `docker system prune` | `docker system prune -a` | Container/image loss |

## Safe exceptions

These patterns are allowed without warning:
- `rm -rf node_modules` / `.next` / `dist` / `__pycache__` / `.cache` / `build` / `.turbo` / `coverage`

## How it works

The hook reads the command from the tool input JSON, checks it against the
patterns above, and returns a `hookSpecificOutput` payload with
`permissionDecision: "ask"` and a warning reason if a match is found (the
decision must be nested under `hookSpecificOutput` — Claude Code ignores a
top-level `permissionDecision`). You can always override a MEDIUM warning and
proceed.

## HIGH tier (hard deny)

Two catastrophic shapes are **denied**, not asked: `rm -r`/`-R` of exactly
`/`, `~`, or `$HOME`, and force-push to the repo's **default branch**. SIMPLE
commands only (no `;`, `&&`, `||`, `|`, newline) — compound shapes fall
through to the MEDIUM ask; `--force-with-lease` is never HIGH. A best-effort
advisory hard-stop, not a policy boundary: the escape hatch is ending the
opt-in, session-scoped /careful session.

## Project patterns (additive only)

Add warn rules — one POSIX ERE per line, `#` comments OK — in
`~/.gstack/careful-patterns.txt` (global) or
`~/.gstack/projects/<slug>/careful-patterns.txt` (per-project). Consulted
after the built-in families, so config can only ADD rules, never suppress a
baseline warning. Invalid regex lines are skipped.

To deactivate, end the conversation or start a new one. Hooks are session-scoped.

## Runtime notes

This file was adapted to be tool-neutral: it claimed a general scope and was
bound to one tool. The procedure is unchanged; what changed is that a reader on a
different runtime is told what to substitute.

- **the `PreToolUse` hook, and the `hookSpecificOutput` payload it returns** —
  the guardrail is not an instruction this file asks you to follow; it is a hook
  the host calls before every `Bash` invocation, and its `permissionDecision`
  must be nested under `hookSpecificOutput` because **Claude Code** ignores a
  top-level one. A runtime that enforces permissions by prompting the user has
  no such payload; apply the same pattern table above yourself at the moment you
  are about to run the command, and say that you did.
- **`$HOME/<agent-config-dir>/gstack/careful/bin/check-careful.sh`** — the hook's
  command, inside the toolkit's install tree. It is one install location among
  several, and the hook payload it produces is the part another runtime would
  need to reproduce.
- **`kubectl delete`, `docker rm -f`** — two tools' destructive commands appear
  in the pattern table. The table is matched literally, so those two rows fire
  only for those two CLIs; the `rm`, `git`, and SQL rows are tool-agnostic and
  are the part that transfers.
Anything marked **means** is an implementation detail of one tool, and a reader
on a different runtime may need a different mechanism for the same step. Anything
marked **subject** means the capability is genuinely about that tool, and a reader
without it should not expect this file to apply.
