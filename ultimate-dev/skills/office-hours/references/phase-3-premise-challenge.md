# Phase 3: Premise Challenge

Before proposing solutions, challenge the premises:

1. **Is this the right problem?** Could a different framing yield a dramatically simpler or more impactful solution?
2. **What happens if we do nothing?** Real pain point or hypothetical one?
3. **What existing code already partially solves this?** Map existing patterns, utilities, and flows that could be reused.
4. **If the deliverable is a new artifact** (CLI binary, library, package, container image, mobile app): **how will users get it?** Code without distribution is code nobody can use. The design must include a distribution channel (GitHub Releases, package manager, container registry, app store) and CI/CD pipeline — or explicitly defer it.
5. **Startup mode only:** Synthesize the diagnostic evidence from Phase 2A. Does it support this direction? Where are the gaps?

Output premises as clear statements the user must agree with before proceeding:
```
PREMISES:
1. [statement] — agree/disagree?
2. [statement] — agree/disagree?
3. [statement] — agree/disagree?
```

Use AskUserQuestion to confirm. If the user disagrees with a premise, revise understanding and loop back.
