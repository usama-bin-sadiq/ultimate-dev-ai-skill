## Pet-Safe Styles

Default style is `auto`: infer the pet's style from the user's prompt and references, then preserve that style across every row. If the user names a style, honor it. Supported style presets include `pixel`, `plush`, `clay`, `sticker`, `flat-vector`, `3d-toy`, `painterly`, `brand-inspired`, and `auto`.

Any style is acceptable when it remains pet-safe:

- compact whole-body silhouette readable inside a `192x208` cell
- consistent face, proportions, material, palette, and props across all rows
- clean removable chroma-key background
- details large enough to read at pet size
- no text, labels, UI, or readable logos unless the user explicitly provides approved reference art and asks for them

Non-pixel styles are first-class. Plush, clay, sticker, vector, 3D toy, painterly mascot, ink, and brand-inspired looks should be accepted when they satisfy the atlas and readability constraints.
