# Phase 7 — SAVE

Report to the user: `[Phase 7/7] Saving knowledge graph...`

1. Write the final knowledge graph to `$UA_DIR/knowledge-graph.json`.

2. **Generate structural fingerprints baseline.** This creates the basis for future automatic incremental updates and **must succeed before `meta.json` is written** — otherwise auto-update sees a fresh commit hash with no fingerprints to compare against, classifies every file as STRUCTURAL, and escalates to `FULL_UPDATE` on every subsequent commit (issue #152).

   Write the input file:
   ```bash
   node - "$PROJECT_ROOT" "$UA_DIR/intermediate/fingerprint-input.json" <<'NODE'
   const fs = require('fs');
   const projectRoot = process.argv[2];
   const outputPath = process.argv[3];
   const input = {
     projectRoot,
     filePaths: [<all analyzed file paths from Phase 1, including non-code files, as JSON array>],
     gitCommitHash: "<current commit hash>",
   };
   fs.writeFileSync(outputPath, JSON.stringify(input, null, 2));
   NODE
   ```

   Then invoke the bundled script (located next to this SKILL.md):
   ```bash
   node "<SKILL_DIR>/build-fingerprints.mjs" \
     "$UA_DIR/intermediate/fingerprint-input.json"
   ```

   The script uses `TreeSitterPlugin + PluginRegistry` exactly like `extract-structure.mjs`, so the baseline matches incremental comparison. The baseline MUST include every file in `scan-result.json`, not only source-code files; unsupported formats receive conservative content-only fingerprints.

   **If the script exits non-zero or stdout does not include `Fingerprints baseline:`, abort Phase 7 and report the error. Do NOT proceed to step 3 (writing `meta.json`).**

3. Write metadata to `$UA_DIR/meta.json` (only after step 2 succeeded):
   ```json
   {
     "lastAnalyzedAt": "<ISO 8601 timestamp>",
     "gitCommitHash": "<commit hash>",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "analyzedFiles": <number of files analyzed>
   }
   ```

4. Clean up intermediate files, **preserving `scan-result.json`** so future incremental runs can skip Phase 1 SCAN (see issue #293). We `mv` scratch dirs into a timestamped `.trash-*` instead of `rm -rf`ing them directly — this avoids tripping destructive-action gates on hardened hosts (e.g. freshness-window checks) that flag deleting directories created moments earlier (see issue #301). The delayed-purge step in Phase 0 reclaims the space once the trash is older than 7 days.
   ```bash
   # Preserve scan-result.json — Phase 1's deterministic file inventory.
   # Future incremental runs (Phase 2 compute-batches.mjs --changed-files=…)
   # need this inventory; without it, Phase 1 must re-dispatch and pay ~157k
   # tokens / ~158s per incremental run.
   TRASH="$UA_DIR/.trash-$(date +%s)"
   mkdir -p "$TRASH"
   INTER="$UA_DIR/intermediate"
   if [ -d "$INTER" ]; then
     # Move every entry except scan-result.json into the trash dir.
     find "$INTER" -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -not -name 'scan-result.json' -exec mv {} "$TRASH/" \; 2>/dev/null || true
   fi
   mv "$UA_DIR/tmp" "$TRASH/" 2>/dev/null || true
   ```

5. Report a summary to the user containing:
   - Project name and description
   - Files analyzed / total files (with breakdown by fileCategory: code, config, docs, infra, data, script, markup)
   - Nodes created (broken down by type: file, function, class, config, document, service, table, endpoint, pipeline, schema, resource)
   - Edges created (broken down by type)
   - Layers identified (with names)
   - Tour steps generated (count)
   - Any warnings from the reviewer
   - Path to the output file: `$UA_DIR/knowledge-graph.json`

6. Only automatically launch the dashboard by invoking the `/understand-dashboard` skill if final graph validation passed after normalization/review fixes.
   If final validation did not pass, report that the graph was saved with warnings and dashboard launch was skipped.
