## Phase 1.5 — BATCH

Report: `[Phase 1.5/7] Computing semantic batches...`

For a full analysis, run the bundled batching script:
```bash
node "<SKILL_DIR>/compute-batches.mjs" "$PROJECT_ROOT"
```

For `PARTIAL_UPDATE` or `ARCHITECTURE_UPDATE`, inspect `filesToReanalyze` from the prepared plan:

- If it is empty, skip batching and file-analyzer entirely. `batch-existing.json` already contains the deletion/ignore cleanup baseline; continue to the merge step in Phase 2. This is the zero-token deletion path.
- Otherwise run batching against the helper-produced file, which contains only structurally changed current files:

  ```bash
  node "<SKILL_DIR>/compute-batches.mjs" "$PROJECT_ROOT" \
    --changed-files="$UA_DIR/intermediate/changed-files.json"
  ```

Both forms read the freshly reconciled `$UA_DIR/intermediate/scan-result.json` and write `$UA_DIR/intermediate/batches.json`.

Capture stderr. Append any line starting with `Warning:` to `$PHASE_WARNINGS` for the final report.

If the script exits non-zero, the failure is hard — relay the full stderr to the user as a Phase 1.5 failure. Do not attempt to recover; the script's internal fallback (count-based) already handles recoverable issues. A non-zero exit means a fundamental problem (missing input file, malformed JSON, etc.).
