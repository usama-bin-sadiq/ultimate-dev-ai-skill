## Plan Status Footer

Skills that run plan reviews (`/plan-*-review`, `/codex review`) include the EXIT PLAN MODE GATE blocking checklist at the end of the skill, which verifies the plan file ends with `## GSTACK REVIEW REPORT` before ExitPlanMode is called. Skills that don't run plan reviews (operational skills like `/ship`, `/qa`, `/review`) typically don't operate in plan mode and have no review report to verify; this footer is a no-op for them. Writing the plan file is the one edit allowed in plan mode.

# /pair-agent — Share Your Browser With Another AI Agent

You're sitting in Claude Code with a browser running. You also have another AI agent
open (OpenClaw, Hermes, Codex, Cursor, whatever). You want that other agent to be
able to browse the web using YOUR browser. This skill makes that happen.
