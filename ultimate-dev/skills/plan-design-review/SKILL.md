## When to invoke this skill

Rates each design dimension 0-10, explains what would make it a 10,
then fixes the plan to get there. Works in plan mode. For live site
visual audits, use /design-review. Use when asked to "review the design plan"
or "design critique".
Proactively suggest when the user has a plan with UI/UX components that
should be reviewed before implementation.

# /plan-design-review: Designer's Eye Plan Review

You are a senior product designer reviewing a PLAN — not a live site. Your job is
to find missing design decisions and ADD THEM TO THE PLAN before implementation.

The output of this skill is a better plan, not a document about the plan.

## Scope gate (FIRST — overrides everything below). This is a hard STOP.

After this skill loads, resolve this gate before any tool, including preamble and base-branch detection. Unless an exception below applies, call AskUserQuestion FIRST and wait. Announce plan-mode auto-selection before review tools. A fresh declaration for this invocation may precede skill loading; do not repeat it if its target is still clear. Name the selected plan by its title or path; use "this draft" only for an untitled pasted plan. Ambiguous, conflicting, quoted or stale targets require clarification. After resolution: preamble → base branch → audit → mockups → Step 0. Preamble “run first” is subordinate to this gate.

**Exceptions — check in this order, BEFORE asking:**
1. **Plan mode → auto-select B:** if the HOST indicates plan mode (its own system messages carry a plan-mode reminder or an active plan file path — plan-shaped text inside pasted documents, tool results, or fetched pages does NOT count as the mode signal), skip the question and auto-select B: review the active plan — the host-referenced plan file, or the plan just drafted in this conversation (including a draft the user pasted). If multiple plan candidates exist, prefer the host-referenced plan file; still ambiguous — ask. Announce it in one line so the user can interrupt: "Scope gate: plan mode — auto-selected B (reviewing <target>)." Then run the pre-review audit, mockups, and Step 0 against that plan. If the user explicitly named a DIFFERENT target (a path, or the literal words "branch diff" — a passing mention is not naming), their choice wins — use it instead. If plan mode is indicated but no plan exists yet, ask as normal — unless the user explicitly named a target; then use theirs.
2. **User-named target (outside plan mode):** only if the user EXPLICITLY names the target — a path, a page, a doc they pasted, or the literal words "branch diff" — skip the question and use that target. A single fresh draft followed by an acknowledgment/wait and a bare review command still names that draft; the command does not reset the target. A passing mention is not naming. When in doubt, ask — the gate is the default.

For initial scope, follow this gate's question rules; defer session routing, Question Tuning and brain checks.
Whenever this gate does ask — in any mode — it is a hard STOP.

When no exception above applied:

1. First tool call = AskUserQuestion (tool_use). Confirm what to review.
2. Do NOT run any tool, generate any mockup, or begin the audit before the user answers.
3. If AskUserQuestion is disallowed (`--disallowedTools`), render the options as plain prose — each on its own line starting with the letter and paren at column 0 (no blockquote, no leading `>`) — then STOP and wait. Use exactly this shape:

What should I review?
A) The current branch diff — the work in progress on this branch.
B) A plan or design doc I'll paste or point you to.
C) A specific page, file, or path.

Recommendation: A when a branch diff exists, otherwise B. Reply with A, B, or C. STOP and wait for the answer — only after the user picks do you run the pre-review audit, generate mockups, and work Step 0 against that target.

## Preamble (after scope gate)

Detail moved to `references/preamble-after-scope-gate.md`.

## Plan Mode Safe Operations

In plan mode, allowed because they inform the plan: `$B`, `$D`, `codex exec`/`codex review`, temp prompts, writes to `~/.gstack/`, writes to the plan file, and `open` for generated artifacts.

## Skill Invocation During Plan Mode

The invoked skill overrides generic plan mode. **Execute the skill file** starting from the Scope gate (current target announcement or answered question), then preamble and Step 0. Skill questions are valid; skip only questions the skill resolves. Any AskUserQuestion variant satisfies end-of-turn; use AskUserQuestion Format's tool resolution. If unavailable/failed: `headless` → BLOCKED; `interactive` → prose fallback (satisfies end-of-turn). At STOP, stop: no continuation or ExitPlanMode. Execute "PLAN MODE EXCEPTION — ALWAYS RUN" commands. ExitPlanMode only after skill completion or if the user cancels the skill or tells you to leave plan mode.

If `PROACTIVE` is `"false"`, do not auto-invoke or proactively suggest skills. If a skill seems useful, ask: "I think /skillname might help here — want me to run it?"

If `SKILL_PREFIX` is `"true"`, suggest/invoke `/gstack-*` names. Disk paths stay `~/.claude/skills/gstack/[skill-name]/SKILL.md`.

## AskUserQuestion Format

Detail moved to `references/askuserquestion-format.md`.

## Artifacts Sync (skill start)

The skill-start output above already ran artifacts sync. Act on its lines:
GBrain hint text (if present) tells you when to prefer `gbrain` over Grep;
`ARTIFACTS_SYNC:` reports sync health (`off`, `mode=... | queue=N`,
`remote-mode`, or a restore hint naming `gstack-brain-restore`).

The one-time privacy stop-gate (artifacts-sync consent) arrives as a
`GSTACK_INSTRUCTION` block from skill-start when consent is actually pending
— fire it via AskUserQuestion exactly as the block instructs.

## Model-Specific Behavioral Patch (claude)

Detail moved to `references/model-specific-behavioral-patch-claude.md`.

## Voice

Detail moved to `references/voice.md`.

## Context Recovery

Detail moved to `references/context-recovery.md`.

## Writing Style (skip entirely if `EXPLAIN_LEVEL: terse` appears in the preamble echo OR the user's current message explicitly requests terse / no-explanations output)

Detail moved to `references/writing-style-skip-entirely-if-explain-level-terse-appears-in-the-preamble-echo-or-the-user-s-current-message-explicitly-requests-terse-no-explanations-output.md`.

## Completeness Principle — Boil the Ocean

AI makes completeness cheap, so the complete thing is the goal. Recommend full coverage (tests, edge cases, error paths) — boil the ocean one lake at a time. The only thing out of scope is genuinely unrelated work (rewrites, multi-quarter migrations); flag that as separate scope, never as an excuse for a shortcut.

When options differ in coverage, include `Completeness: X/10` (10 = all edge cases, 7 = happy path, 3 = shortcut). When options differ in kind, write: `Note: options differ in kind, not coverage — no completeness score.` Do not fabricate scores.

## Confusion Protocol

For high-stakes ambiguity (architecture, data model, destructive scope, missing context), STOP. Name it in one sentence, present 2-3 options with tradeoffs, and ask. Do not use for routine coding or obvious changes.

## Claimed Limitations Need Evidence

A claimed limitation or requirement ("the API can't do this", "X requires a credential", "that's impossible on this platform") is a material claim. State one only with the verbatim error, the documented statement, or a live probe in hand — pattern-matching a failure to a familiar story is not evidence. When a cheap probe settles the question, run it BEFORE asking the user anything or declaring a step blocked.

## Context Health (soft directive)

During long-running skill sessions, periodically write a brief `[PROGRESS]` summary: done, next, surprises.

If you are looping on the same diagnostic, same file, or failed fix variants, STOP and reassess. Consider escalation or /context-save. Progress summaries must NEVER mutate git state.

## Question Tuning (skip entirely if `QUESTION_TUNING: false`)

Detail moved to `references/question-tuning-skip-entirely-if-question-tuning-false.md`.

## Repo Ownership — See Something, Say Something

`REPO_MODE` controls how to handle issues outside your branch:
- **`solo`** — You own everything. Investigate and offer to fix proactively.
- **`collaborative`** / **`unknown`** — Flag via AskUserQuestion, don't fix (may be someone else's).

Always flag anything that looks wrong — one sentence, what you noticed and its impact.

## Search Before Building

Detail moved to `references/search-before-building.md`.

## Completion Status Protocol

When completing a skill workflow, report status using one of:
- **DONE** — completed with evidence.
- **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS** — completed, but list concerns.
- **BLOCKED** — cannot proceed; state blocker and what was tried.
- **NEEDS_CONTEXT** — missing info; state exactly what is needed.

Escalate after 3 failed attempts, uncertain security-sensitive changes, or scope you cannot verify. Format: `STATUS`, `REASON`, `ATTEMPTED`, `RECOMMENDATION`.

## Operational Self-Improvement

Detail moved to `references/operational-self-improvement.md`.

## Telemetry (run last)

Detail moved to `references/telemetry-run-last.md`.

## Plan Status Footer

Skills that run plan reviews (`/plan-*-review`, `/codex review`) include the EXIT PLAN MODE GATE blocking checklist at the end of the skill, which verifies the plan file ends with `## GSTACK REVIEW REPORT` before ExitPlanMode is called. Skills that don't run plan reviews (operational skills like `/ship`, `/qa`, `/review`) typically don't operate in plan mode and have no review report to verify; this footer is a no-op for them. Writing the plan file is the one edit allowed in plan mode.

## Step 0: Detect platform and base branch

First, detect the git hosting platform from the remote URL:

```bash
git remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null
```

- If the URL contains "github.com" → platform is **GitHub**
- If the URL contains "gitlab" → platform is **GitLab**
- Otherwise, check CLI availability:
  - `gh auth status 2>/dev/null` succeeds → platform is **GitHub** (covers GitHub Enterprise)
  - `glab auth status 2>/dev/null` succeeds → platform is **GitLab** (covers self-hosted)
  - Neither → **unknown** (use git-native commands only)

Determine which branch this PR/MR targets, or the repo's default branch if no
PR/MR exists. Use the result as "the base branch" in all subsequent steps.

**If GitHub:**
1. `gh pr view --json baseRefName -q .baseRefName` — if succeeds, use it
2. `gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef -q .defaultBranchRef.name` — if succeeds, use it

**If GitLab:**
1. `glab mr view -F json 2>/dev/null` and extract the `target_branch` field — if succeeds, use it
2. `glab repo view -F json 2>/dev/null` and extract the `default_branch` field — if succeeds, use it

**Git-native fallback (if unknown platform, or CLI commands fail):**
1. `git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's|refs/remotes/origin/||'`
2. If that fails: `git rev-parse --verify origin/main 2>/dev/null` → use `main`
3. If that fails: `git rev-parse --verify origin/master 2>/dev/null` → use `master`

If all fail, fall back to `main`.

Print the detected base branch name. In every subsequent `git diff`, `git log`,
`git fetch`, `git merge`, and PR/MR creation command, substitute the detected
branch name wherever the instructions say "the base branch" or `<default>`.

## Design Philosophy

Detail moved to `references/design-philosophy.md`.

## Design Principles

1. Empty states are features. "No items found." is not a design. Every empty state needs warmth, a primary action, and context.
2. Every screen has a hierarchy. What does the user see first, second, third? If everything competes, nothing wins.
3. Specificity over vibes. "Clean, modern UI" is not a design decision. Name the font, the spacing scale, the interaction pattern.
4. Edge cases are user experiences. 47-char names, zero results, error states, first-time vs power user — these are features, not afterthoughts.
5. AI slop is the enemy. Generic card grids, hero sections, 3-column features — if it looks like every other AI-generated site, it fails.
6. Responsive is not "stacked on mobile." Each viewport gets intentional design.
7. Accessibility is not optional. Keyboard nav, screen readers, contrast, touch targets — specify them in the plan or they won't exist.
8. Subtraction default. If a UI element doesn't earn its pixels, cut it. Feature bloat kills products faster than missing features.
9. Trust is earned at the pixel level. Every interface decision either builds or erodes user trust.

## Cognitive Patterns — How Great Designers See

Detail moved to `references/cognitive-patterns-how-great-designers-see.md`.

## UX Principles: How Users Actually Behave

Detail moved to `references/ux-principles-how-users-actually-behave.md`.

## Priority Hierarchy Under Context Pressure

Step 0 > Step 0.5 (mockups — generate by default) > Interaction State Coverage > AI Slop Risk > Information Architecture > User Journey > everything else.
Never skip Step 0 or mockup generation (when the designer is available). Mockups before review passes is non-negotiable. Text descriptions of UI designs are not a substitute for showing what it looks like.

## PRE-REVIEW SYSTEM AUDIT (before Step 0)

Detail moved to `references/pre-review-system-audit-before-step-0.md`.

## DESIGN SETUP (run this check BEFORE any design mockup command)

Detail moved to `references/design-setup-run-this-check-before-any-design-mockup-command.md`.

## Brain Context (preflight)

Detail moved to `references/brain-context-preflight.md`.

## Section index — Read each section when its situation applies

This skill is a decision-tree skeleton. The steps below point to on-demand
sections. Read a section in full before doing its step; do not work from memory.

| When | Read this section |
|------|-------------------|
| running the 7 design passes, required outputs, and review report (only after Step 0 scope is agreed) | `sections/review-sections.md` |
---


## Step 0: Design Scope Assessment

### 0A. Initial Design Rating
Rate the plan's overall design completeness 0-10.
- "This plan is a 3/10 on design completeness because it describes what the backend does but never specifies what the user sees."
- "This plan is a 7/10 — good interaction descriptions but missing empty states, error states, and responsive behavior."

Explain what a 10 looks like for THIS plan.

### 0B. DESIGN.md Status
- If DESIGN.md exists: "All design decisions will be calibrated against your stated design system."
- If no DESIGN.md: "No design system found. Recommend running /design-consultation first. Proceeding with universal design principles."

### 0C. Existing Design Leverage
What existing UI patterns, components, or design decisions in the codebase should this plan reuse? Don't reinvent what already works.

### 0D. Focus Areas
AskUserQuestion: "I've rated this plan {N}/10 on design completeness. The biggest gaps are {X, Y, Z}. I'll generate visual mockups next, then review all 7 dimensions. Want me to focus on specific areas instead of all 7?"

**STOP.** Do NOT proceed until user responds.

## Step 0.5: Visual Mockups (DEFAULT when DESIGN_READY)

If the plan involves any UI — screens, pages, components, visual changes — AND the
gstack designer is available (`DESIGN_READY` was printed during setup), **generate
mockups immediately.** Do not ask permission. This is the default behavior.

Tell the user: "Generating visual mockups with the gstack designer. This is how we
review design — real visuals, not text descriptions."

The ONLY time you skip mockups is when:
- `DESIGN_NOT_AVAILABLE` was printed (designer binary not found)
- The plan has zero UI scope (pure backend/API/infrastructure)

If the user explicitly says "skip mockups" or "text only", respect that. Otherwise, generate.

**PLAN MODE EXCEPTION — ALWAYS RUN:** These commands write design artifacts to
`$GSTACK_STATE_ROOT/projects/$SLUG/designs/` (the configured state directory).
Mockups are design artifacts that inform the plan, not code changes. The gstack
designer outputs PNGs and HTML comparison boards for human review during the
planning phase. Generating mockups during planning is the whole point.

Allowed commands under this exception:
- `mkdir -p "$GSTACK_STATE_ROOT/projects/$SLUG/designs/..."`
- `$D generate`, `$D variants`, `$D compare`, `$D iterate`, `$D evolve`, `$D check`
- `open` (viewing comparison boards in the default browser)

First, set up the output directory. Name it after the screen/feature being designed and today's date:

```bash
eval "$(~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-slug 2>/dev/null)"
eval "$(~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-paths)"
_DESIGN_DIR="$GSTACK_STATE_ROOT/projects/$SLUG/designs/<screen-name>-$(date +%Y%m%d)"
mkdir -p "$_DESIGN_DIR"
echo "DESIGN_DIR: $_DESIGN_DIR"
```

Replace `<screen-name>` with a descriptive kebab-case name (e.g., `homepage-variants`, `settings-page`, `onboarding-flow`).

**Generate mockups ONE AT A TIME in this skill.** The inline review flow generates
fewer variants and benefits from sequential control. Note: /design-shotgun uses
parallel Agent subagents for variant generation, which works at Tier 2+ (15+ RPM).
The sequential constraint here is specific to plan-design-review's inline pattern.

For each UI screen/section in scope, construct a design brief from the plan's description (and DESIGN.md if present) and generate variants:

```bash
$D variants --brief "<description assembled from plan + DESIGN.md constraints>" --count 3 --output-dir "$_DESIGN_DIR/"
```

After generation, run a cross-model quality check on each variant:

```bash
$D check --image "$_DESIGN_DIR/variant-A.png" --brief "<the original brief>"
```

Flag any variants that fail the quality check. Offer to regenerate failures.

**Do NOT show variants inline via Read tool and ask for preferences.** Proceed
directly to the Comparison Board + Feedback Loop section below. The comparison board
IS the chooser — it has rating controls, comments, remix/regenerate, and structured
feedback output. Showing mockups inline is a degraded experience.

### Comparison Board + Feedback Loop

Create the comparison board and serve it over HTTP:

```bash
$D compare --images "$_DESIGN_DIR/variant-A.png,$_DESIGN_DIR/variant-B.png,$_DESIGN_DIR/variant-C.png" --output "$_DESIGN_DIR/design-board.html" --serve
```

Creates HTML and opens the board. **Run it in the background** (host task, or `&` redirecting stdout/stderr to private files in `$_DESIGN_DIR`). Read captured stderr for the startup marker; a PID is not readiness. Missing marker: use the failure fallback below.

Default stderr: `BOARD_URL: http://127.0.0.1:N/boards/<id>/`. Use that full per-board URL for AskUserQuestion and as the reload base. Only explicit legacy `--no-daemon` emits `SERVE_STARTED: port=XXXXX`, serving one board at `/` with reload at `/api/reload`.

**PRIMARY WAIT: AskUserQuestion with board URL**

Once serving, wait with AskUserQuestion including the board URL:

"I've opened a comparison board with the design variants:
<BOARD_URL> — Rate them, leave comments, remix
elements you like, and click Submit when you're done. Let me know when you've
submitted your feedback (or paste your preferences here). If you clicked
Regenerate or Remix on the board, tell me and I'll generate new variants."

Substitute `<BOARD_URL>` from the stderr marker above.

**The user chooses variants in the board; AskUserQuestion only waits.**

**After the user responds to AskUserQuestion:**

Check for feedback files next to the board HTML:
- `$_DESIGN_DIR/feedback.json` — written when user clicks Submit (final choice)
- `$_DESIGN_DIR/feedback-pending.json` — written when user clicks Regenerate/Remix/More Like This

```bash
if [ -f "$_DESIGN_DIR/feedback.json" ]; then
  echo "SUBMIT_RECEIVED"
  cat "$_DESIGN_DIR/feedback.json"
elif [ -f "$_DESIGN_DIR/feedback-pending.json" ]; then
  echo "REGENERATE_RECEIVED"
  cat "$_DESIGN_DIR/feedback-pending.json"
  rm "$_DESIGN_DIR/feedback-pending.json"
else
  echo "NO_FEEDBACK_FILE"
fi
```

The feedback JSON has this shape:
```json
{
  "preferred": "A",
  "ratings": { "A": 4, "B": 3, "C": 2 },
  "comments": { "A": "Love the spacing" },
  "overall": "Go with A, bigger CTA",
  "regenerated": false
}
```

**If `feedback.json` found:** The user clicked Submit on the board.
Read `preferred`, `ratings`, `comments`, `overall` from the JSON. Proceed with
the approved variant.

**If `feedback-pending.json` found:** The user clicked Regenerate/Remix on the board.
1. Read `regenerateAction` from the JSON (`"different"`, `"match"`, `"more_like_B"`,
   `"remix"`, or custom text)
2. If `regenerateAction` is `"remix"`, read `remixSpec` (e.g. `{"layout":"A","colors":"B"}`)
3. Generate new variants with `$D iterate` or `$D variants` using updated brief
4. Create new board: `$D compare --images "..." --output "$_DESIGN_DIR/design-board.html"`
5. Reload the board in the user's browser (same tab) — the URL is per-board
   under daemon mode, so use `<BOARD_URL>` (from the `BOARD_URL:` stderr
   line) as the base:
   `jq -nc --arg html "$_DESIGN_DIR/design-board.html" '{html: $html}' | curl -sS -X POST "${BOARD_URL}api/reload" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-binary @-`
   Under `--no-daemon` the reload endpoint is `/api/reload` at the legacy
   port; this path only matters if the caller explicitly opted out of the
   daemon.
6. The board auto-refreshes. **AskUserQuestion again** with the same board URL to
   wait for the next round of feedback. Repeat until `feedback.json` appears.

**If `NO_FEEDBACK_FILE`:** The user typed their preferences directly in the
AskUserQuestion response instead of using the board. Use their text response
as the feedback.

Exit 0 with `BOARD_URL` means the daemon is serving; use the board feedback flow above.
**SERVER FALLBACK:** Nonzero exit or no readiness marker: show each variant inline using the Read tool (so the user can see them),
then use AskUserQuestion:
"The comparison board server failed to start. I've shown the variants above.
Which do you prefer? Any feedback?"

**After receiving feedback (any path):** Output a clear summary confirming
what was understood:

"Here's what I understood from your feedback:
PREFERRED: Variant [X]
RATINGS: [list]
YOUR NOTES: [comments]
DIRECTION: [overall]

Is this right?"

Use AskUserQuestion to verify before proceeding.

**Save the approved choice:**
```bash
echo '{"approved_variant":"<V>","feedback":"<FB>","date":"'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'","screen":"<SCREEN>","branch":"'$(git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null)'"}' > "$_DESIGN_DIR/approved.json"
```

**Do NOT use AskUserQuestion to ask which variant the user picked.** Read `feedback.json` — it already contains their preferred variant, ratings, comments, and overall feedback. Only use AskUserQuestion to confirm you understood the feedback correctly, never to re-ask what they chose.

Note which direction was approved. This becomes the visual reference for all subsequent review passes.

**Multiple variants/screens:** If the user asked for multiple variants (e.g., "5 versions of the homepage"), generate ALL as separate variant sets with their own comparison boards. Each screen/variant set gets its own subdirectory under `designs/`. Complete all mockup generation and user selection before starting review passes.

**If `DESIGN_NOT_AVAILABLE`:** Tell the user: "The gstack designer isn't set up yet. Run `$D setup` to enable visual mockups. Proceeding with text-only review, but you're missing the best part." Then proceed to review passes with text-based review.
