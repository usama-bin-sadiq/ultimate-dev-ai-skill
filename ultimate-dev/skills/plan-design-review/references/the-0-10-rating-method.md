## The 0-10 Rating Method

For each design section, rate the plan 0-10 on that dimension. If it's not a 10, explain WHAT would make it a 10 — then resolve each gap with the user.

Pattern:
1. Rate: "Information Architecture: 4/10"
2. Gap: "It's a 4 because the plan doesn't define content hierarchy. A 10 would have clear primary/secondary/tertiary for every screen."
3. Recommend: Explain the concrete fix, alternatives, and why you recommend it.
4. AskUserQuestion once for this issue and wait for the user's decision.
5. Apply only the selected fix; it does not authorize other amendments. Then re-rate: "Now 8/10 — still missing mobile nav hierarchy"
6. Repeat per unresolved issue until 10 or the user says "good enough, move on".

A gap already listed in the input plan is still an unresolved review finding.
Knowing its cause or the matching DESIGN.md token does not approve the change.
Review each such gap individually; do not batch them into one "apply all fixes"
question or silently resolve them in the initial plan write. Honor an explicit
user decision already made for that exact change across all passes. Apply the
selected fix to every affected plan reference, including the matching established
DESIGN.md tokens, without asking again. Reopen it only when new evidence exposes
an unresolved design requirement or tradeoff; explain what changed.

Re-run loop: invoke /plan-design-review again → re-rate → sections at 8+ get a quick pass, sections below 8 get full treatment.

### "Show me what 10/10 looks like" (requires design binary)

If `DESIGN_READY` was printed during setup AND a dimension rates below 7/10,
offer to generate a visual mockup showing what the improved version would look like:

```bash
eval "$(~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-slug 2>/dev/null)"
eval "$(~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-paths)"
_DESIGN_DIR="$GSTACK_STATE_ROOT/projects/$SLUG/designs/ideal-$(date +%Y%m%d)"
mkdir -p "$_DESIGN_DIR"
_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)
D="$_ROOT/.claude/skills/gstack/design/dist/design"
[ -x "$D" ] || D=~/.claude/skills/gstack/design/dist/design
"$D" generate --brief "<description of what 10/10 looks like for this dimension>" --output "$_DESIGN_DIR/ideal-<dimension>.png"
echo "IDEAL_IMAGE: $_DESIGN_DIR/ideal-<dimension>.png"
```

Show the mockup to the user via the Read tool. This makes the gap between
"what the plan describes" and "what it should look like" visceral, not abstract.

If the design binary is not available, skip this and continue with text-based
descriptions of what 10/10 looks like.

> **STOP.** Before running the 7 design passes, required outputs, and review report (only after Step 0 scope is agreed), Read `~/.claude/skills/gstack/plan-design-review/sections/review-sections.md` and execute it
