## Setup

**Parse the user's request for these parameters:**

| Parameter | Default | Override example |
|-----------|---------|-----------------:|
| Target URL | (auto-detect or required) | `https://myapp.com`, `http://localhost:3000` |
| Mode | full | `--quick`, `--regression .gstack/qa-reports/baseline.json` |
| Output dir | `.gstack/qa-reports/` | `Output to /tmp/qa` |
| Scope | Full app (or diff-scoped) | `Focus on the billing page` |
| Auth | Your Aside session (already signed in) | If a sign-in wall appears, you sign in yourself in Aside — no credentials in chat (see BROWSER SETUP). Fallback browser only: /setup-browser-cookies or `$B handoff` |

**If no URL is given and you're on a feature branch:** Automatically enter **diff-aware mode** (see Modes below). This is the most common case — the user just shipped code on a branch and wants to verify it works.

**Browser: Aside**
