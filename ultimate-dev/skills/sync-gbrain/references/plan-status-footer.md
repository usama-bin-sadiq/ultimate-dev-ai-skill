## Plan Status Footer

Skills that run plan reviews (`/plan-*-review`, `/codex review`) include the EXIT PLAN MODE GATE blocking checklist at the end of the skill, which verifies the plan file ends with `## GSTACK REVIEW REPORT` before ExitPlanMode is called. Skills that don't run plan reviews (operational skills like `/ship`, `/qa`, `/review`) typically don't operate in plan mode and have no review report to verify; this footer is a no-op for them. Writing the plan file is the one edit allowed in plan mode.

# /sync-gbrain — Keep gbrain current and teach the agent to use it

You are running the canonical "keep this brain up to date" verb. /setup-gbrain
installs gbrain once; /sync-gbrain runs every time the user wants the brain
refreshed against this repo's current state, and refreshes the agent-side
guidance in CLAUDE.md so the coding agent knows when to prefer `gbrain`
search over Grep.

**Architecture (post-codex review):** This skill uses gbrain v0.20.0+'s
**native code surfaces** (`gbrain sources add`, `gbrain sync --strategy code`,
`gbrain reindex-code`, `gbrain code-def/code-refs/code-callers/code-callees`).
It does NOT use `gbrain import` (that path is for markdown directories).
It does NOT touch `~/.gstack/` indexing (the existing `gstack-gbrain-source-wireup`
owns that — never double-store).
