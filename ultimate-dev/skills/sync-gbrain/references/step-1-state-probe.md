## Step 1: State probe

Before doing anything, check that /setup-gbrain has been run on this Mac.

```bash
~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-gbrain-detect 2>/dev/null
```

**Brain trust policy gate (v1.48 / Phase 1.5 / D4 — added by T13+T5c):**
If `gbrain_mcp_mode == "remote-http"` from the detect output AND the per-
endpoint policy is `unset`, the policy question MUST fire here before
the orchestrator runs. Local engines auto-set to `personal` silently per
the per-transport default table.

```bash
_HASH=$(~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-config endpoint-hash 2>/dev/null)
_POLICY=$(~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-config get brain_trust_policy@$_HASH 2>/dev/null || echo unset)
echo "BRAIN_TRUST_POLICY[$_HASH]: $_POLICY"
```

If `_POLICY == "unset"` AND `_HASH != "local"`, AskUserQuestion per the
Step 9.5 wording in `/setup-gbrain` (personal vs shared, with persistence
to `brain_trust_policy@<hash>` and conditional `artifacts_sync_mode=full`
flip for personal). Then continue.

If `_POLICY == "unset"` AND `_HASH == "local"`, auto-set personal:

```bash
~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-config set brain_trust_policy@$_HASH personal
```

**Split-engine model (v1.34.0.0+).** Code stage runs locally against the
per-machine gbrain engine (PGLite or whatever `gbrain config` points to),
with each worktree of a repo registered as its own source. **Memory stage
also runs locally** in local-stdio MCP mode — `gstack-memory-ingest` shells
out to `gbrain import` against the same local engine. In remote-http MCP
mode (Path 4), the memory stage instead persists staged markdown to
`~/.gstack/transcripts/<run-id>/` and the artifacts pipeline pushes it to
the brain admin's pull job (plan D11). Brain-sync (the `gstack-brain-sync`
push to git) is the one stage that never touches local engine and runs
regardless of mode.

Practically: local PGLite stays code-only on remote-http machines; the
remote brain holds everything else. Local-stdio machines mix code +
transcripts in one local engine, as they always have.

Also check the per-repo trust policy. If `gstack-gbrain-repo-policy get` for
this repo returns `deny`, STOP:

> "This repo's gbrain trust policy is `deny`. Run `/setup-gbrain --repo` to
> change it before syncing."
