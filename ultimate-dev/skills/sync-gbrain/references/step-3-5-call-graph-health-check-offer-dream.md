## Step 3.5: Call-graph health check (offer `--dream`)

`gbrain code-callers` / `code-callees` (who-calls-this / what-this-calls) return
`count: 0` until a `gbrain dream` cycle runs the `resolve_symbol_edges` phase for
this source — not done by the code import in Step 2.

**One hard prerequisite:** building a call graph requires this source's active
**schema pack to extract code symbols** (the `extract_atoms` phase). On a pack
that doesn't declare it (e.g. `gbrain-base` / `gbrain-base-v2`), a `dream` cycle
completes but `resolve_symbol_edges` matches nothing — the graph stays empty no
matter how many times you run it. So "build the call graph" is only meaningful on
a code-aware pack. The `--dream` stage detects this and reports it honestly
(a WARN row) rather than claiming a build that didn't happen. gbrain exposes pack
capability only at cycle runtime (no pre-flight query as of 0.41.x), so we can't
detect it before running. `code-def` / `code-refs` need the same symbol
extraction; they are NOT free "direct lookups" on a non-code-aware pack.

Detect whether this source's call graph is built via doctor's `cycle_freshness`
check, matching the cwd `SOURCE_ID` literally:

```bash
SOURCE_JSON=$(bun run ~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-gbrain-read-capability.ts --source-only 2>/dev/null)
SOURCE_ID=$(printf '%s' "$SOURCE_JSON" | jq -er 'if .status=="source" then .source_id else empty end' 2>/dev/null)
CYCLE=unknown
if [ -n "$SOURCE_ID" ]; then
  CYCLE=$(gbrain doctor --json --fast 2>/dev/null \
    | jq -er --arg id "$SOURCE_ID" '
        if type=="object" and has("error") then empty
        else (.checks[]? | select(.name=="cycle_freshness")) as $c
          | if $c.status=="ok" then "completed"
            elif (($c.message // "") | index($id)) then "never"
            else "unknown" end end' 2>/dev/null || echo unknown)
fi
# index($id) = literal substring (NOT test() regex), matching the lib reader in
# cycleCompleted(). A fail/warn that doesn't name this source → "unknown" (don't
# mask other-source failures).
echo "call graph for $SOURCE_ID: $CYCLE"
```

If `CYCLE == never` AND the user did NOT pass `--dream`/`--full` AND Step 3
`PAGES > 0`, AskUserQuestion via the format in the preamble:

> D2 — This repo's call graph isn't built. Build it now?
>
> ELI10: `gbrain code-callers`/`code-callees` (who calls this function / what it

If A: re-invoke the orchestrator with `--dream --code-only` (skips memory +
brain-sync; the dream stage still runs because it's gated on `--dream`). Then
report the dream stage's ACTUAL row — `OK call graph built (N edges)` vs a
`WARN` that names why the graph is still empty (non-code-aware pack, missing
embedding key, or 0 edges matched). Do not claim success on a WARN.
If B: continue to Step 4 with the call-graph-not-built state recorded for the
verdict.

If `CYCLE == completed` or `unknown`, do not prompt — but note `completed` means
only that a cycle has run, not that edges exist (a non-code-aware pack reports
`completed` with an empty graph). Step 5's verdict row surfaces the real state.
