description: Create institutional-quality equity research initiation reports through a 5-task workflow. Tasks must be executed individually with verified prerequisites - (1) company research, (2) financial modeling, (3) valuation analysis, (4) chart generation, (5) final report assembly. Each task produces specific deliverables (markdown docs, Excel models, charts, or DOCX reports). Tasks 3-5 have dependencies on earlier tasks.

# Initiating Coverage

Create institutional-quality equity research initiation reports through a structured 5-task workflow. Each task must be executed separately with verified inputs.

## Overview

This skill produces comprehensive first-time coverage reports following institutional standards (JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley format). Tasks are executed individually, each verifying prerequisites before proceeding.

**Default Font**: Times New Roman throughout all documents (unless user specifies otherwise).

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: One Task at a Time

**THIS SKILL OPERATES IN SINGLE-TASK MODE ONLY.**

### If User Requests Full Pipeline

When user requests:
- "Create a coverage initiation report for [Company]"
- "Write an initiation report for [Company]"
- "Do the entire equity research process for [Company]"
- "Complete all 5 tasks for [Company]"
- Any request that implies running multiple tasks or the entire workflow

**REQUIRED RESPONSE:**

1. **Ask which specific task to perform:**
   ```
   I can help you create an equity research initiation report for [Company].
   This involves 5 separate tasks that need to be completed individually:

   1. Company Research - Research business, management, industry
   2. Financial Modeling - Build projection model
   3. Valuation Analysis - DCF and comparable companies
   4. Chart Generation - Create 25-35 charts
   5. Report Assembly - Compile final report

   Which task would you like to start with?
   ```

2. **When user explicitly requests all tasks together:**
   ```
   I understand you'd like to complete the entire initiation report pipeline.
   Currently, this skill supports executing one task at a time, which allows
   for better quality control and review at each stage.

   We're working on a seamless end-to-end workflow that will make this process
   more automated, but for now, we'll need to complete each task separately.

   Would you like to start with Task 1 (Company Research)?
   ```

3. **Never automatically assume which task to start** - always ask user to confirm.

4. **Never execute multiple tasks in sequence** - complete one task, deliver outputs, then wait for next user request.

### Task Execution Rules

- ✅ Execute exactly ONE task per user request
- ✅ Always verify prerequisites before starting a task
- ✅ Deliver task outputs and confirm completion
- ✅ Wait for user to explicitly request the next task
- ❌ Never chain multiple tasks together automatically
- ❌ Never assume user wants to proceed to next task
- ❌ Never execute Tasks 3-5 without verifying required inputs exist

### ⚠️ Deliverables Policy: NO SHORTCUTS

**DELIVER ONLY THE SPECIFIED OUTPUTS. DO NOT CREATE EXTRA DOCUMENTS.**

Each task specifies exact deliverables. Do NOT create:
- ❌ "Completion summaries"
- ❌ "Executive summaries"
- ❌ "Quick reference guides"
- ❌ "Next steps documents"
- ❌ "Task completion reports"
- ❌ Any other "helpful" documentation not explicitly specified

**Why**: These extras waste context and are not part of the professional workflow.

**What TO deliver**:
- ✅ Task 1: Research document (.md) — **NOTHING ELSE**
- ✅ Task 2: Financial model (.xlsx) — **NOTHING ELSE**
- ✅ Task 3: Valuation analysis (.md) + Excel tabs added to Task 2 file — **NOTHING ELSE**
- ✅ Task 4: Charts zip file (.zip) — **NOTHING ELSE**
- ✅ Task 5: Final report (.docx) — **NOTHING ELSE**

**If a deliverable is not listed above, DO NOT CREATE IT.**

## Task Selection

Select which task to execute:

| Task | Name | Prerequisites | Output |
|------|------|--------------|--------|
| **1** | Company Research | Company name/ticker | 6-8K word document |
| **2** | Financial Modeling | 10-K or financials access | Excel model (6 tabs) |
| **3** | Valuation Analysis | Financial model (Task 2) | Valuation + price target |
| **4** | Chart Generation | Tasks 1, 2, 3 + external data | 25-35 PNG/JPG charts |
| **5** | Report Assembly | ALL previous tasks (1-4) | 30-50 page DOCX report |

## How to Use This Skill

### User Request Patterns and Responses

**Pattern 1: User specifies a specific task**
```
User: "Use initiating-coverage, Task 1 for Tesla"
Response: ✅ Execute Task 1 immediately
```

**Pattern 2: User asks for "initiation report" or "full pipeline"**
```
User: "Create a coverage initiation report for Tesla"
Response: ❌ DO NOT start any task automatically
         ✅ Ask which task to start with (see template above)
```

**Pattern 3: User wants to do "all tasks" or "entire workflow"**
```
User: "I want to complete all 5 tasks for Tesla"
Response: ❌ DO NOT chain tasks together
         ✅ Explain one-at-a-time limitation (see template above)
         ✅ Ask if they want to start with Task 1
```

### Correct Usage Examples

**Executing a single task:**
```
"Use initiating-coverage skill, Task 1 for Tesla"
"Do Task 2 of initiating-coverage for Tesla"
"Run Task 3 for Tesla using the initiating-coverage skill"
```

**Completing full report (requires 5 separate requests):**
```
Request 1: "Do Task 1 for Tesla" → Complete → Deliver outputs
Request 2: "Do Task 2 for Tesla" → Complete → Deliver outputs
Request 3: "Do Task 3 for Tesla" → Complete → Deliver outputs
Request 4: "Do Task 4 for Tesla" → Complete → Deliver outputs
Request 5: "Do Task 5 for Tesla" → Complete → Deliver outputs
```

### Task Execution Order

For a complete initiation report, tasks must be executed in separate user requests following this order:

```
Request 1: Task 1 - Company Research (independent)
           ↓ [User reviews outputs and requests next task]
Request 2: Task 2 - Financial Modeling (independent)
           ↓ [User reviews outputs and requests next task]
Request 3: Task 3 - Valuation Analysis (requires Task 2 output)
           ↓ [User reviews outputs and requests next task]
Request 4: Task 4 - Chart Generation (requires Tasks 2 & 3 outputs)
           ↓ [User reviews outputs and requests next task]
Request 5: Task 5 - Report Assembly (requires ALL previous task outputs)
```

**Note**: Tasks 1 and 2 can be run in any order. Tasks 3-5 have strict dependencies and must verify inputs before proceeding.
