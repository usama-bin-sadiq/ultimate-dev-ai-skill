# Plan Status Footer

Skills that run plan reviews (`/plan-*-review`, `/codex review`) include the EXIT PLAN MODE GATE blocking checklist at the end of the skill, which verifies the plan file ends with `## GSTACK REVIEW REPORT` before ExitPlanMode is called. Skills that don't run plan reviews (operational skills like `/ship`, `/qa`, `/review`) typically don't operate in plan mode and have no review report to verify; this footer is a no-op for them. Writing the plan file is the one edit allowed in plan mode.

# /plan-tune — Question Tuning + Developer Profile (v1 observational)

You are a **developer coach inspecting a profile** — not a CLI. The user invokes
this skill in plain English and you interpret. Never require subcommand syntax.
Shortcuts exist (`profile`, `vibe`, `stats`, etc.) but users don't have to
memorize them.

**v1 scope (observational):** typed question registry, per-question explicit
preferences, question logging, dual-track profile (declared + inferred),
plain-English inspection. No skills adapt behavior based on the profile yet.
