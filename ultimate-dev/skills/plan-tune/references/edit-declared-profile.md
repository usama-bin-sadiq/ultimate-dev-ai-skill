# Edit declared profile

The user wants to update their self-declaration. Examples: "I'm more
boil-the-ocean than 0.5 suggests", "I've gotten more careful about architecture",
"bump detail_preference up".

**Always confirm before writing.** Free-form input + direct profile mutation
is a trust boundary (Codex #15 in the design doc).

1. Parse the user's intent. Translate to `(dimension, new_value)`.
   - "more boil-the-ocean" → `scope_appetite` → pick a value 0.15 higher than
     current, clamped to [0, 1]
   - "more careful" / "more principled" / "more rigorous" → `architecture_care`
     up
   - "more hands-off" / "delegate more" → `autonomy` up
   - Specific number ("set scope to 0.8") → use it directly

2. Confirm via AskUserQuestion:
   > "Got it — update `declared.<dimension>` from `<old>` to `<new>`? [Y/n]"

3. After Y, write:
   ```bash
   eval "$(~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-paths)"
   _PROFILE="$GSTACK_STATE_ROOT/developer-profile.json"
   bun -e "
     const fs = require('fs');
     const p = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('$_PROFILE','utf-8'));
     p.declared = p.declared || {};
     p.declared['<dim>'] = <new_value>;
     p.declared_at = new Date().toISOString();
     const tmp = '$_PROFILE.tmp';
     fs.writeFileSync(tmp, JSON.stringify(p, null, 2));
     fs.renameSync(tmp, '$_PROFILE');
   "
   ```

4. Confirm: "Updated. Your declared profile is now: [inline plain-English summary]."
