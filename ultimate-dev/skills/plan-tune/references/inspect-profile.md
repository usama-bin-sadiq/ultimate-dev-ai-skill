## Inspect profile

```bash
~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-developer-profile --profile
```

Parse the JSON. Present in **plain English**, not raw floats:

- For each dimension where `declared[dim]` is set, translate to a plain-English
  statement. Use these bands:
  - 0.0-0.3 → "low" (e.g., `scope_appetite` low = "small scope, ship fast")
  - 0.3-0.7 → "balanced"
  - 0.7-1.0 → "high" (e.g., `scope_appetite` high = "boil the ocean")

  Format: "**scope_appetite:** 0.8 (boil the ocean — you prefer the complete
  version with edge cases covered)"

- If `inferred.diversity` passes the **display gate** (`sample_size >= 20 AND
  skills_covered >= 3 AND question_ids_covered >= 8 AND days_span >= 7`), show
  the inferred column next to declared:
  "**scope_appetite:** declared 0.8 (boil the ocean) ↔ observed 0.72 (close)"
  Use words for the gap: 0.0-0.1 "close", 0.1-0.3 "drift", 0.3+ "mismatch".

  This display gate is intentionally lower than the E1 **promotion gate**
  (90+ days stable across 3+ skills).
  Displaying inferred values is a UI affordance; shipping behavior-adapting
  defaults based on the profile is consequential and needs a much higher
  bar. Do NOT use the display gate as a green light for v2 E1 work.

- If the calibration gate isn't met, say: "Not enough observed data yet —
  need N more events across M more skills before we can show your observed
  profile."

- Show the vibe (archetype) from `gstack-developer-profile --vibe` — the
  one-word label + one-line description. Only if calibration gate met OR
  if declared is filled (so there's something to match against).
