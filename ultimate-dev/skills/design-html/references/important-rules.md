# Important Rules

- **Source of truth fidelity over code elegance.** When an approved mockup exists,
  pixel-match it. If that requires `width: 312px` instead of a CSS grid class, that's
  correct. When in plan-driven or freeform mode, the user's feedback during the
  refinement loop is the source of truth. Code cleanup happens later during
  component extraction.

- **Always use Pretext for text layout.** Even if the design looks simple, Pretext
  ensures correct height computation on resize. The overhead is 30KB. Every page benefits.

- **Surgical edits in the refinement loop.** Use the Edit tool to make targeted changes,
  not the Write tool to regenerate the entire file. The user may have made manual edits
  via contenteditable that should be preserved.

- **Real content only.** When a mockup exists, extract text from it. In plan-driven mode,
  use content from the plan. In freeform mode, generate realistic content based on the
  user's description. Never use "Lorem ipsum", "Your text here", or placeholder content.

- **One page per invocation.** For multi-page designs, run /design-html once per page.
  Each run produces one HTML file.
