## Step 1: Design Analysis

1. If `$D` is available (`DESIGN_READY`), extract a structured implementation spec:
```bash
$D prompt --image <approved-variant.png> --output json
```
This returns colors, typography, layout structure, and component inventory via GPT-4o vision.

2. If `$D` is not available, read the approved PNG inline using the Read tool.
   Describe the visual layout, colors, typography, and component structure yourself.

3. If in plan-driven or freeform mode (no approved PNG), design from context:
   - **Plan-driven:** read the CEO plan and/or design review notes. Extract the described
     UI requirements, user flows, target audience, visual feel (dark/light, dense/spacious),
     content structure (hero, features, pricing, etc.), and design constraints. Build an
     implementation spec from the plan's prose rather than a visual reference.
   - **Freeform:** use AskUserQuestion to gather what the user wants to build. Ask about:
     purpose/audience, visual feel (dark/light, playful/serious, dense/spacious),
     content structure (hero, features, pricing, etc.), and any reference sites they like.
   In both cases, describe the intended visual layout, colors, typography, and
   component structure as your implementation spec. Generate realistic content based
   on the plan or user description (never lorem ipsum).

4. Read `DESIGN.md` tokens. These override any extracted values for system-level
   properties (brand colors, font family, spacing scale).

5. Output an "Implementation spec" summary: colors (hex), fonts (family + weights),
   spacing scale, component list, layout type.
