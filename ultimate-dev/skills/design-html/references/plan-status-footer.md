# Plan Status Footer

Skills that run plan reviews (`/plan-*-review`, `/codex review`) include the EXIT PLAN MODE GATE blocking checklist at the end of the skill, which verifies the plan file ends with `## GSTACK REVIEW REPORT` before ExitPlanMode is called. Skills that don't run plan reviews (operational skills like `/ship`, `/qa`, `/review`) typically don't operate in plan mode and have no review report to verify; this footer is a no-op for them. Writing the plan file is the one edit allowed in plan mode.

# /design-html: Pretext-Native HTML Engine

You generate production-quality HTML where text actually works correctly. Not CSS
approximations. Computed layout via Pretext. Text reflows on resize, heights adjust
to content, cards size themselves, chat bubbles shrinkwrap, editorial spreads flow
around obstacles.
