<!-- Moved verbatim from skillify/SKILL.md, the

     unchanged, and it is here so SKILL.md stays the routing
     surface rather than a manual. -->

## Step 2 — Propose name + triggers

From the prototype intent, extract:

- A short skill name: lowercase letters/digits/dashes, ≤32 chars,
  starts with a letter, no consecutive dashes. E.g.,
  `lobsters-frontpage`, `gh-issue-list`, `pypi-package-stats`.
- 3–5 trigger phrases the agent should match against in future `/scrape`
  calls. Mix the canonical phrase ("scrape lobsters frontpage") with
  paraphrases ("top posts on lobste.rs", "lobsters front page").
- The host (just the hostname, e.g. `lobste.rs`).

Then **AskUserQuestion** to confirm:

```
D<N> — Skill name + tier
Project/branch/task: codifying /scrape "<intent>" as a browser-skill.
ELI10: Pick a short name we'll use to find this skill next time you say
something similar. Pick a tier — global means every project on this
machine sees it, project means just this repo.
Stakes if we pick wrong: bad name buries the skill in $B skill list;
wrong tier means future projects can't find it (or can find it when you
didn't want them to).
Recommendation: A — <proposed-name> at global tier — most scrape skills
generalize across projects.
Note: options differ in kind, not coverage — no completeness score.
A) Keep "<proposed-name>" at global tier — ~/.gstack/browser-skills/<proposed-name>/  (recommended)
B) Keep "<proposed-name>" but at project tier — <project>/.gstack/browser-skills/<proposed-name>/
C) Rename it (free-form — say the new name)
```

**Tier-shadowing check.** Before showing the question, run `$B skill list`
and check for an existing skill at the same name. If found, add to the
question:

> "Note: a <tier> skill named '<name>' already exists. Picking the same
> name at a higher tier (project > global > bundled) shadows it; picking
> the same tier collides and will be refused at write time. Pick a
> different name to coexist."
