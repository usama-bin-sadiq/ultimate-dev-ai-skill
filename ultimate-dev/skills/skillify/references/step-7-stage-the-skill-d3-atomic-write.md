<!-- Moved verbatim from skillify/SKILL.md, the
     'step-7-stage-the-skill-d3-atomic-write' section. The split is mechanical: the content is
     unchanged, and it is here so SKILL.md stays the routing
     surface rather than a manual. -->

## Step 7 — Stage the skill (D3 atomic write)

Use the helper at `browse/src/browser-skill-write.ts`. Construct an inline
TypeScript snippet (or shell out to a small Bun one-liner) that calls:

```ts
import { stageSkill } from '<gstack-install>/browse/src/browser-skill-write';

const stagedDir = stageSkill({
  name: '<name>',
  files: new Map([
    ['SKILL.md', skillMd],
    ['script.ts', scriptTs],
    ['script.test.ts', scriptTestTs],
    ['_lib/browse-client.ts', sdkContents],
    ['fixtures/<host>-<date>.html', fixtureHtml],
  ]),
});
console.log(stagedDir);
```

The SKILL.md content for `<name>` follows the Phase 1 frontmatter
contract:

```yaml
---
name: <name>
description: <one-line, what data this returns>
host: <hostname>
trusted: false       # agent-authored skills are untrusted by default
source: agent
version: 1.0.0
args: []             # extend if your script accepts --arg key=value
triggers:
  - <phrase 1>
  - <phrase 2>
  - <phrase 3>
---

# <Name> scraper

<2-3 sentences on what the script does, what URL it hits, and what
shape of JSON it returns. NO conversation context. NO chat fragments.
This is a durable on-disk artifact — keep it tight.>
