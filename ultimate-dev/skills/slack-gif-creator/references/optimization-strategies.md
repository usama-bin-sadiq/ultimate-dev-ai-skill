# Optimization Strategies

When your GIF is too large:

**For Message GIFs (>2MB):**
1. Reduce frames (lower FPS or shorter duration)
2. Reduce colors (128 → 64 colors)
3. Reduce dimensions (480x480 → 320x320)
4. Enable duplicate frame removal

**For Emoji GIFs (>64KB) - be aggressive:**
1. Limit to 10-12 frames total
2. Use 32-40 colors maximum
3. Avoid gradients (solid colors compress better)
4. Simplify design (fewer elements)
5. Use `optimize_for_emoji=True` in save method
