<!-- Moved verbatim from ship/SKILL.md, the

     unchanged, and it is here so SKILL.md stays the routing
     surface rather than a manual. -->

## Step 3: Merge the base branch (BEFORE tests)

Merge the base ref fetched in Step 1 so tests and reviews cover the integrated code:

```bash
git merge origin/<base> --no-edit
```

**If there are merge conflicts:** Try to auto-resolve if they are simple (VERSION, schema.rb, CHANGELOG ordering). If conflicts are complex or ambiguous, **STOP** and show them.

**If already up to date:** Continue silently.

> **STOP.** Before running the test suites and (if prompt files changed) the eval suites (Steps 4-6), Read `~/.claude/skills/gstack/ship/sections/tests.md` and execute it
> in full. Do not work from memory — that section is the source of truth for this step.

> **STOP.** Before auditing test coverage of the diff (Step 7), Read `~/.claude/skills/gstack/ship/sections/test-coverage.md` and execute it
> in full. Do not work from memory — that section is the source of truth for this step.

> **STOP.** Before auditing plan completion, verification, and scope drift (Step 8), Read `~/.claude/skills/gstack/ship/sections/plan-completion.md` and execute it
> in full. Do not work from memory — that section is the source of truth for this step.

> **STOP.** Before the pre-landing review and specialist dispatch (Step 9), Read `~/.claude/skills/gstack/ship/sections/review-army.md` and execute it
> in full. Do not work from memory — that section is the source of truth for this step.

> **STOP.** Before addressing Greptile review comments when a PR exists (Step 10), Read `~/.claude/skills/gstack/ship/sections/greptile.md` and execute it
> in full. Do not work from memory — that section is the source of truth for this step.

> **STOP.** Before the adversarial review and learnings capture (Step 11), Read `~/.claude/skills/gstack/ship/sections/adversarial.md` and execute it
> in full. Do not work from memory — that section is the source of truth for this step.
