## Prune

Check learnings for staleness and contradictions.

```bash
eval "$(~/<agent-config-dir>/gstack/bin/gstack-slug 2>/dev/null)"
~/<agent-config-dir>/gstack/bin/gstack-learnings-search --limit 100 2>/dev/null
```

For each learning in the output:

1. **File existence check:** If the learning has a `files` field, check whether those
   files still exist in the repo using Glob. If any referenced files are deleted, flag:
   "STALE: [key] references deleted file [path]"

2. **Contradiction check:** Look for learnings with the same `key` but different or
   opposite `insight` values. Flag: "CONFLICT: [key] has contradicting entries —
   [insight A] vs [insight B]"

Present each flagged entry via AskUserQuestion:
- A) Remove this learning
- B) Keep it
- C) Update it (I'll tell you what to change)

For removals, read the learnings.jsonl file and remove the matching line, then write
back. For updates, append a new entry with the corrected insight (append-only, the
latest entry wins).
