# Step 6: Save & Next Steps

Write `approved.json` to `$_DESIGN_DIR/` (handled by the loop above).

If invoked from another skill: return the structured feedback for that skill to consume.
The calling skill reads `approved.json` and the approved variant PNG.

If standalone, offer next steps via AskUserQuestion:

> "Design direction locked in. What's next?
> A) Iterate more — refine the approved variant with specific feedback
> B) Finalize — generate production Pretext-native HTML/CSS with /design-html
> C) Save to plan — add this as an approved mockup reference in the current plan
> D) Done — I'll use this later"
