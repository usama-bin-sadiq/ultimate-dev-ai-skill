## Step 2: Taste Memory

Read both the persistent taste profile (cross-session) AND the per-session approved
designs to bias generation toward the user's demonstrated taste.

**Persistent taste profile (v1 schema at `~/.gstack/projects/$SLUG/taste-profile.json`):**

Read this project's taste profile:

```bash
eval "$("~/<agent-config-dir>/gstack/bin/gstack-slug" 2>/dev/null)"
[ -n "${SLUG:-}" ] || { echo "NO_TASTE_PROFILE"; exit 0; }
_TASTE_PROFILE=~/.gstack/projects/$SLUG/taste-profile.json
if [ -f "$_TASTE_PROFILE" ]; then
  # Schema v1: { dimensions: { fonts, colors, layouts, aesthetics }, sessions: [] }
  # Each dimension has approved[] and rejected[] entries with
  # { value, confidence, approved_count, rejected_count, last_seen }
  # Confidence decays 5% per week of inactivity — computed at read time.
  cat "$_TASTE_PROFILE" 2>/dev/null
  echo "TASTE_PROFILE_FOUND"
else
  echo "NO_TASTE_PROFILE"
fi
```

**If TASTE_PROFILE_FOUND:** Parse the full JSON; malformed/unreadable uses the legacy fallback. After decay, rank each dimension by confidence * approved_count (or rejected_count); take three per kind. Count retained sessions (at most 50, not lifetime). Include in the brief:

"Based on [number of retained sessions] recorded sessions, this user's taste leans toward:
fonts [top-3], colors [top-3], layouts [top-3], aesthetics [top-3]. Bias
generation toward these unless the user explicitly requests a different direction.
Also avoid their strong rejections: [top-3 rejected per dimension]."

**Legacy fallback:** Glob `~/.gstack/projects/$SLUG/designs/**/approved.json`; Read the five newest. Use explicit feedback only, never infer fonts/colors from variant letters. No usable files: continue without a taste profile.

**Conflict handling:** If the current user request contradicts a strong persistent
signal (e.g., "make it playful" when taste profile strongly prefers minimal), flag
it: "Note: your taste profile strongly prefers minimal. You're asking for playful
this time — I'll proceed, but want me to update the taste profile, or treat this
as a one-off?"

**Decay:** Multiply stored confidence by 0.95 raised to elapsed weeks since last_seen (minimum zero weeks). Skip invalid dates/confidence; do not rewrite the file while reading.

**Schema migration:** If the file has no `version` field or `version: 0`, it's
the legacy approved.json aggregate — `~/<agent-config-dir>/gstack/bin/gstack-taste-update`
will migrate it to schema v1 on the next write.

**Per-session approved.json files (legacy, still supported):**

```bash
eval "$(~/<agent-config-dir>/gstack/bin/gstack-slug 2>/dev/null)"
eval "$(~/<agent-config-dir>/gstack/bin/gstack-paths)"
setopt +o nomatch 2>/dev/null || true
_TASTE=$(find "$GSTACK_STATE_ROOT/projects/$SLUG/designs/" -name "approved.json" -maxdepth 2 2>/dev/null | sort -r | head -10)
```

If prior sessions exist, read each `approved.json` and extract patterns from the
approved variants. Merge these into the taste-profile.json-derived signal — if the
profile already says "user prefers Geist font" (from aggregated history), the
approved.json files add the specific recent approval context.

Limit to last 10 sessions. Try/catch JSON parse on each (skip corrupted files).

**Updating taste profile after a design-shotgun session:** When the user picks a
variant, call `~/<agent-config-dir>/gstack/bin/gstack-taste-update approved <variant-path>`. When they
explicitly reject a variant, call `~/<agent-config-dir>/gstack/bin/gstack-taste-update rejected <variant-path>`.
The CLI handles schema migration from approved.json, decay, and conflict flagging.
