description: Real DCF (Discounted Cash Flow) model creation for equity valuation. Retrieves financial data from SEC filings and analyst reports, builds comprehensive cash flow projections with proper WACC calculations, performs sensitivity analysis, and outputs professional Excel models with executive summaries. Use when users need to value a company using DCF methodology, request intrinsic value analysis, or ask for detailed financial modeling with growth projections and terminal value calculations.

# DCF Model Builder

## Overview

This skill creates institutional-quality DCF models for equity valuation following investment banking standards. Each analysis produces a detailed Excel model (with sensitivity analysis included at the bottom of the DCF sheet).

## Tools

- Default to using all of the information provided by the user and MCP servers available for data sourcing.

## Critical Constraints - Read These First

## Excel File Creation

**This skill uses the `xlsx` skill for all spreadsheet operations.** The xlsx skill provides:
- Standardized formula construction rules
- Number formatting conventions
- Automated formula recalculation via `recalc.py` script
- Comprehensive error checking and validation

All Excel files created by this skill must follow xlsx skill requirements, including zero formula errors and proper recalculation.

## Quality Rubric

Every DCF model must maximize for:
1. **Realistic revenue and margin assumptions** based on historical performance
2. **Appropriate cost of capital calculation** with proper CAPM methodology
3. **Comprehensive sensitivity analysis** showing valuation ranges
4. **Clear terminal value calculation** with supporting rationale
5. **Professional model structure** enabling scenario analysis
6. **Transparent documentation** of all key assumptions

## Input Requirements

### Minimum Required Inputs
1. **Company identifier**: Ticker symbol or company name
2. **Growth assumptions**: Revenue growth rates for projection period (or "use consensus")
3. **Optional parameters**:
   - Projection period (default: 5 years)
   - Scenario cases (Bear/Base/Bull growth and margin assumptions)
   - Terminal growth rate (default: 2.5-3.0%)
   - Specific WACC inputs if not using CAPM

## Excel Model Structure

## Case Selector Implementation

**Three-Case Framework:**

### Bear Case
- Conservative revenue growth (low end of historical range)
- Margin compression or no expansion
- Higher WACC (risk premium increase)
- Lower terminal growth rate
- Higher CapEx assumptions

### Base Case
- Consensus or management guidance revenue growth
- Moderate margin expansion based on operating leverage
- Current market-implied WACC
- GDP-aligned terminal growth (2.5-3.0%)
- Standard CapEx assumptions

### Bull Case
- Optimistic revenue growth (high end of projections)
- Significant margin expansion
- Lower WACC (reduced risk premium)
- Higher terminal growth (3.5-5.0%)
- Reduced CapEx intensity

**Formula Implementation:**

**DO NOT use nested IF formulas scattered throughout.** Instead, create a consolidation column that uses INDEX or OFFSET formulas to pull from the appropriate scenario block.

**Recommended pattern (using INDEX):**
`=INDEX(B10:D10, 1, $B$6)` where `B10:D10` = Bear/Base/Bull values, `1` = row offset, `$B$6` = case selector cell (1, 2, or 3)

**Then reference the consolidation column** in all projections:
`Revenue Year 1: =D29*(1+$E$10)` where $E$10 is the consolidation column value for Year 1 growth.

This approach centralizes scenario logic, making the model easier to audit and maintain.

## Deliverables Structure

**File naming**: `[Ticker]_DCF_Model_[Date].xlsx`

**Two sheets**:
1. **DCF** - Complete model with Bear/Base/Bull cases + three sensitivity tables at bottom (WACC vs Terminal Growth, Revenue Growth vs EBIT Margin, Beta vs Risk-Free Rate)
2. **WACC** - Cost of capital calculation

**Key features**: Case selector (1/2/3), consolidation column with INDEX/OFFSET formulas, color-coded cells, cell comments on all inputs, professional borders

## Best Practices

### Model Construction
1. **Build incrementally**: Complete each section before moving to next
2. **Test as building**: Enter sample numbers to verify formulas
3. **Use consistent structure**: Similar calculations follow similar patterns
4. **Comment complex formulas**: Add notes for unusual calculations
5. **Build in checks**: Sum checks and balance checks where applicable

### Documentation
1. **Document all assumptions**: Explain reasoning behind key inputs
2. **Cite data sources**: Note where each data point came from
3. **Explain methodology**: Describe any non-standard approaches
4. **Flag uncertainties**: Highlight areas with limited visibility

### Quality Control
1. **Cross-check calculations**: Verify math in multiple ways
2. **Stress test assumptions**: Run sensitivity to ensure model is robust
3. **Peer review**: Have someone else check formulas
4. **Version control**: Save versions as work progresses

## Common Variations

### High-Growth Technology Companies
- Longer projection period (7-10 years)
- Higher initial growth rates (20-30%)
- Significant margin expansion over time
- Higher WACC (12-15%)
- Model unit economics (users, ARPU, etc.)

### Mature/Stable Companies
- Shorter projection period (3-5 years)
- Modest growth rates (GDP +1-3%)
- Stable margins
- Lower WACC (7-9%)
- Focus on cash generation and capital allocation

### Cyclical Companies
- Model through economic cycle
- Normalize margins at mid-cycle
- Consider trough and peak scenarios
- Adjust beta for cyclicality

### Multi-Segment Companies
- Separate DCFs for each business unit
- Different growth rates and margins by segment
- Sum-of-parts valuation
- Consider synergies

## Final Output Checklist

Before delivering DCF model:

**Required:**
- Run `python recalc.py model.xlsx 30` until status is "success" (zero formula errors)
- Two sheets: DCF (with sensitivity at bottom), WACC
- Font colors: Blue=inputs, Black=formulas, Green=sheet links
- Cell comments on ALL hardcoded inputs
- Sensitivity tables fully populated with formulas
- Professional borders around major sections

**Validation:**
- OpEx based on revenue (not gross profit)
- Terminal value 50-70% of EV
- Terminal growth < WACC
- Tax rate 21-28%
- File naming: `[Ticker]_DCF_Model_[Date].xlsx`
