## Workflow Integration

### At Start of DCF Build

1. **Gather market data**:
   - Check for available MCP servers for current market data
   - Use web search/fetch for stock prices, beta, and other market metrics
   - Request from user if specific data is needed

2. **Gather historical financials**:
   - Check for available MCP servers (Daloopa, etc.)
   - Request from user if not available via MCP
   - Manual extraction from 10-Ks if necessary

3. **Begin model construction** using the DCF methodology detailed in this skill

### During Model Construction

1. **Build Excel model** using openpyxl with formulas (not hardcoded values)
2. **Follow xlsx skill conventions** for formula construction and formatting
3. **Apply fill colors only if requested** by user or if specific brand guidelines are provided

### Before Delivering Model (MANDATORY)

1. **Verify structure**:
   - Scenario blocks for Bear/Base/Bull with assumptions across projection years
   - Case selector functional with formulas referencing correct scenario blocks
   - Sensitivity tables at bottom of DCF sheet (not separate sheet)
   - Font colors: Blue inputs, black formulas, green sheet links
   - Cell comments on ALL hardcoded inputs
   - Professional borders around major sections

2. **Recalculate formulas**: Run `python recalc.py model.xlsx 30`

3. **Check output**:
   - If `status` is `"success"` → Continue to step 4
   - If `status` is `"errors_found"` → Check `error_summary`

4. **Fix errors and re-run recalc.py** until status is "success"

5. **Spot-check formulas**:
   - Test one FCF formula - does it reference the correct assumption rows?
   - Change case selector - does the consolidation column update properly?
   - Verify revenue formulas reference consolidation column (not nested IF formulas)

6. **Deliver model**

### Available Data Sources

- **MCP servers**: If configured (Daloopa for historical financials)
- **Web search/fetch**: For current stock prices, beta, and market data
- **User-provided data**: Historical financials, consensus estimates
- **Manual extraction**: SEC EDGAR filings as fallback
