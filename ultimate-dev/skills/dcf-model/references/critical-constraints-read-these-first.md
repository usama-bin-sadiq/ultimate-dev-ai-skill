## Critical Constraints - Read These First

These constraints apply throughout all DCF model building. Review before starting:

**Environment: Office JS vs Python/openpyxl:**
- **If running inside Excel (Office Add-in / Office JS environment):** Use Office JS directly — do NOT use Python/openpyxl. Write formulas via `range.formulas = [["=D19*(1+$B$8)"]]`. No separate recalc step needed; Excel calculates natively. Use `range.format.*` for styling. The same formulas-over-hardcodes rule applies: set `.formulas`, never `.values` for derived cells.
- **If generating a standalone .xlsx file (no live Excel session):** Use Python/openpyxl as described below, then run `recalc.py` before delivery.
- The rest of this skill uses openpyxl examples — translate to Office JS API calls when in that environment, but all principles (formula strings, cell comments, section checkpoints, sensitivity table loops) apply identically.

**⚠️ Office JS merged cell pitfall:** When building section headers with merged cells, do NOT call `.merge()` then set `.values` on the merged range — Office JS still reports the range's original dimensions and will throw `InvalidArgument: The number of rows or columns in the input array doesn't match the size or dimensions of the range`. Instead, write the value to the top-left cell alone, then merge and format the full range:

```js
// WRONG — throws InvalidArgument:
const hdr = ws.getRange("A7:H7");
hdr.merge();
hdr.values = [["MARKET DATA & KEY INPUTS"]];  // 1×1 array vs 1×8 range → fails

// CORRECT — value first on single cell, then merge + format the range:
ws.getRange("A7").values = [["MARKET DATA & KEY INPUTS"]];
const hdr = ws.getRange("A7:H7");
hdr.merge();
hdr.format.fill.color = "#1F4E79";
hdr.format.font.bold = true;
hdr.format.font.color = "#FFFFFF";
```

This applies to every merged section header in the DCF (market data, scenario blocks, cash flow projection, terminal value, valuation summary, sensitivity tables).

**Formulas Over Hardcodes (NON-NEGOTIABLE):**
- Every projection, margin, discount factor, PV, and sensitivity cell MUST be a live Excel formula — never a value computed in Python and written as a number
- When using openpyxl: `ws["D20"] = "=D19*(1+$B$8)"` is correct; `ws["D20"] = calculated_revenue` is WRONG
- The only hardcoded numbers permitted are: (1) raw historical inputs, (2) assumption drivers (growth rates, WACC inputs, terminal g), (3) current market data (share price, debt balance)
- If you catch yourself computing something in Python and writing the result — STOP. The model must flex when the user changes an assumption.

**Verify Step-by-Step With the User (DO NOT build end-to-end):**
- After data retrieval → show the user the raw inputs block (revenue, margins, shares, net debt) and confirm before projecting
- After revenue projections → show the projected top line and growth rates, confirm before building margin build
- After FCF build → show the full FCF schedule, confirm logic before computing WACC
- After WACC → show the calculation and inputs, confirm before discounting
- After terminal value + PV → show the equity bridge (EV → equity value → per share), confirm before sensitivity tables
- Catch errors at each stage — a wrong margin assumption discovered after sensitivity tables are built means rebuilding everything downstream

**Sensitivity Tables:**
- **Use an ODD number of rows and columns** (standard: 5×5, sometimes 7×7) — this guarantees a true center cell
- **Center cell = base case.** Build the axis values so the middle row header and middle column header exactly equal the model's actual assumptions (e.g., if base WACC = 9.0%, the middle row is 9.0%; if terminal g = 3.0%, the middle column is 3.0%). The center cell's output must therefore equal the model's actual implied share price — this is the sanity check that the table is built correctly.
- **Highlight the center cell** with the medium-blue fill (`#BDD7EE`) + bold font so it's immediately visible which cell is the base case.
- Populate ALL cells (typically 3 tables × 25 cells = 75) with full DCF recalculation formulas
- Use openpyxl loops (or Office JS loops) to write formulas programmatically
- NO placeholder text, NO linear approximations, NO manual steps required
- Each cell must recalculate full DCF for that assumption combination

**Cell Comments:**
- Add cell comments AS each hardcoded value is created
- Format: "Source: [System/Document], [Date], [Reference], [URL if applicable]"
- Every blue input must have a comment before moving to next section
- Do not defer to end or write "TODO: add source"

**Model Layout Planning:**
- Define ALL section row positions BEFORE writing any formulas
- Write ALL headers and labels first
- Write ALL section dividers and blank rows second
- THEN write formulas using the locked row positions
- Test formulas immediately after creation

**Formula Recalculation:**
- Run `python recalc.py model.xlsx 30` before delivery
- Fix ALL errors until status is "success"
- Zero formula errors required (#REF!, #DIV/0!, #VALUE!, etc.)

**Scenario Blocks:**
- Create separate blocks for Bear/Base/Bull cases
- Show assumptions horizontally across projection years within each block
- Use IF formulas: `=IF($B$6=1,[Bear cell],IF($B$6=2,[Base cell],[Bull cell]))`
- Verify formulas reference correct scenario block cells
