## Case Selector Implementation

**Three-Case Framework:**

### Bear Case
- Conservative revenue growth (low end of historical range)
- Margin compression or no expansion
- Higher WACC (risk premium increase)
- Lower terminal growth rate
- Higher CapEx assumptions

### Base Case
- Consensus or management guidance revenue growth
- Moderate margin expansion based on operating leverage
- Current market-implied WACC
- GDP-aligned terminal growth (2.5-3.0%)
- Standard CapEx assumptions

### Bull Case
- Optimistic revenue growth (high end of projections)
- Significant margin expansion
- Lower WACC (reduced risk premium)
- Higher terminal growth (3.5-5.0%)
- Reduced CapEx intensity

**Formula Implementation:**

**DO NOT use nested IF formulas scattered throughout.** Instead, create a consolidation column that uses INDEX or OFFSET formulas to pull from the appropriate scenario block.

**Recommended pattern (using INDEX):**
`=INDEX(B10:D10, 1, $B$6)` where `B10:D10` = Bear/Base/Bull values, `1` = row offset, `$B$6` = case selector cell (1, 2, or 3)

**Then reference the consolidation column** in all projections:
`Revenue Year 1: =D29*(1+$E$10)` where $E$10 is the consolidation column value for Year 1 growth.

This approach centralizes scenario logic, making the model easier to audit and maintain.
