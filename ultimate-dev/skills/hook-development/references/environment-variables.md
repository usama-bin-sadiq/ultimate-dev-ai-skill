## Environment Variables

Available in all command hooks:

- `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` - Project root path
- `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` - Plugin directory (use for portable paths)
- `$CLAUDE_ENV_FILE` - SessionStart only: persist env vars here
- `$CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE` - Set if running in remote context

**Always use ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} in hook commands for portability:**

```json
{
  "type": "command",
  "command": "bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/validate.sh"
}
```
