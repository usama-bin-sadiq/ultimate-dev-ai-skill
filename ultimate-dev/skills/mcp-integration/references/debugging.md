# Debugging

### Enable Debug Logging

```bash
claude --debug
```

Look for:
- MCP server connection attempts
- Tool discovery logs
- Authentication flows
- Tool call errors

### Common Issues

**Server not connecting:**
- Check URL is correct
- Verify server is running (stdio)
- Check network connectivity
- Review authentication configuration

**Tools not available:**
- Verify server connected successfully
- Check tool names match exactly
- Run `/mcp` to see available tools
- Restart Claude Code after config changes

**Authentication failing:**
- Clear cached auth tokens
- Re-authenticate
- Check token scopes and permissions
- Verify environment variables set
