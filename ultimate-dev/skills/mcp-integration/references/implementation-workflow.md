# Implementation Workflow

To add MCP integration to a plugin:

1. Choose MCP server type (stdio, SSE, HTTP, ws)
2. Create `.mcp.json` at plugin root with configuration
3. Use ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} for all file references
4. Document required environment variables in README
5. Test locally with `/mcp` command
6. Pre-allow MCP tools in relevant commands
7. Handle authentication (OAuth or tokens)
8. Test error cases (connection failures, auth errors)
9. Document MCP integration in plugin README

Focus on stdio for custom/local servers, SSE for hosted services with OAuth.
