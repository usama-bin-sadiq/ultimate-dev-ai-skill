## Workflows

### Workflow 1: Security Audit

Complete security assessment of a codebase.

```bash
# Step 1: Scan for code vulnerabilities
python scripts/security_scanner.py . --severity medium
# STOP if exit code 2 — resolve critical findings before continuing
```

```bash
# Step 2: Check dependency vulnerabilities
python scripts/vulnerability_assessor.py . --severity high
# STOP if exit code 2 — patch critical CVEs before continuing
```

```bash
# Step 3: Verify compliance controls
python scripts/compliance_checker.py . --framework all
# STOP if exit code 2 — address critical gaps before proceeding
```

```bash
# Step 4: Generate combined reports
python scripts/security_scanner.py . --json --output security.json
python scripts/vulnerability_assessor.py . --json --output vulns.json
python scripts/compliance_checker.py . --json --output compliance.json
```

### Workflow 2: CI/CD Security Gate

Integrate security checks into deployment pipeline.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/security.yml
name: "security-scan"

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, develop]

jobs:
  security-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: "set-up-python"
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'

      - name: "security-scanner"
        run: python scripts/security_scanner.py . --severity high

      - name: "vulnerability-assessment"
        run: python scripts/vulnerability_assessor.py . --severity critical

      - name: "compliance-check"
        run: python scripts/compliance_checker.py . --framework soc2
```

Each step fails the pipeline on its respective exit code — no deployment proceeds past a critical finding.

### Workflow 3: CVE Triage

Respond to a new CVE affecting your application.

```
1. ASSESS (0-2 hours)
   - Identify affected systems using vulnerability_assessor.py
   - Check if CVE is being actively exploited
   - Determine CVSS environmental score for your context
   - STOP if CVSS 9.0+ on internet-facing system — escalate immediately

2. PRIORITIZE
   - Critical (CVSS 9.0+, internet-facing): 24 hours
   - High (CVSS 7.0-8.9): 7 days
   - Medium (CVSS 4.0-6.9): 30 days
   - Low (CVSS < 4.0): 90 days

3. REMEDIATE
   - Update affected dependency to fixed version
   - Run security_scanner.py to verify fix (must return exit code 0)
   - STOP if scanner still flags the CVE — do not deploy
   - Test for regressions
   - Deploy with enhanced monitoring

4. VERIFY
   - Re-run vulnerability_assessor.py
   - Confirm CVE no longer reported
   - Document remediation actions
```

### Workflow 4: Incident Response

Security incident handling procedure.

```
PHASE 1: DETECT & IDENTIFY (0-15 min)
- Alert received and acknowledged
- Initial severity assessment (SEV-1 to SEV-4)
- Incident commander assigned
- Communication channel established

PHASE 2: CONTAIN (15-60 min)
- Affected systems identified
- Network isolation if needed
- Credentials rotated if compromised
- Preserve evidence (logs, memory dumps)

PHASE 3: ERADICATE (1-4 hours)
- Root cause identified
- Malware/backdoors removed
- Vulnerabilities patched (run security_scanner.py; must return exit code 0)
- Systems hardened

PHASE 4: RECOVER (4-24 hours)
- Systems restored from clean backup
- Services brought back online
- Enhanced monitoring enabled
- User access restored

PHASE 5: POST-INCIDENT (24-72 hours)
- Incident timeline documented
- Root cause analysis complete
- Lessons learned documented
- Preventive measures implemented
- Stakeholder report delivered
```
