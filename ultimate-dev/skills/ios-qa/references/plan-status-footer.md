## Plan Status Footer

Skills that run plan reviews (`/plan-*-review`, `/codex review`) include the EXIT PLAN MODE GATE blocking checklist at the end of the skill, which verifies the plan file ends with `## GSTACK REVIEW REPORT` before ExitPlanMode is called. Skills that don't run plan reviews (operational skills like `/ship`, `/qa`, `/review`) typically don't operate in plan mode and have no review report to verify; this footer is a no-op for them. Writing the plan file is the one edit allowed in plan mode.

# Live-device iOS QA

This skill drives a real iPhone via USB. The agent reads your Swift source,
generates typed state accessors, deploys a debug bridge, and runs a closed
find→fix→verify loop. No simulator, no XCTest, no WebDriverAgent.
